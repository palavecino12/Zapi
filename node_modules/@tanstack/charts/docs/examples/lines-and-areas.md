title: Lines and Areas
description: Choose and compose line, range-area, rolling-statistic, and annotation patterns for ordered data.

Lines answer how a value changes across an ordered domain. Areas add a second
meaning: distance from a baseline or the span between two boundaries. Use that
extra area only when the reader should compare magnitude, accumulation, or an
interval—not merely because a filled chart looks stronger.

## Choose the comparison

| Reader question                                          | Start with                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How does one measure change over time?                   | One line with an explicit temporal scale                                                    |
| How do several measures change together?                 | Several lines with direct labels or a legend                                                |
| Where does one measure exceed another?                   | A difference mark with distinct positive and negative fills                                 |
| What is the local trend after reducing short-term noise? | A raw line plus a clearly named rolling statistic                                           |
| What range surrounds a central estimate?                 | An area with explicit lower and upper channels                                              |
| Which observations deserve explanation?                  | A line plus selected text, dots, rules, or bands                                            |
| How does composition change over time?                   | A stacked or normalized area in [Stacked and Composed Charts](./stacked-and-composition.md) |

The x domain must have a meaningful order. Do not connect nominal categories
just because they appear in an array.

## Start with one ordered series

Use one line when the first task is reading change over a shared sequence.
Points keep the individual observations available for focus and tooltips.

```ts group=basic-line env=charts file=/src/chart.ts entry
import { defineChart, lineY } from '@tanstack/charts'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { scalePoint } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/point'

const rows = [
  { month: 'Jan', downloads: 42 },
  { month: 'Feb', downloads: 58 },
  { month: 'Mar', downloads: 51 },
  { month: 'Apr', downloads: 73 },
  { month: 'May', downloads: 81 },
]

const chart = defineChart({
  marks: [
    lineY(rows, {
      x: 'month',
      y: 'downloads',
      points: true,
      stroke: '#2563eb',
      lineCap: 'butt',
    }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: () => scalePoint<string>().padding(0.2) },
    y: {
      scale: scaleLinear,
      nice: true,
      grid: true,
      axis: { label: 'Downloads (thousands)' },
    },
  },
})

export default chart
```

`lineCap: 'butt'` ends the stroke at each path endpoint. Omit it to retain the
default round endpoints. `lineX` accepts the same `lineCap` and `lineJoin`
options.

## Compare several series from a common baseline

Indexing each series to its first observation compares relative change when the
original magnitudes are not directly comparable. Direct end labels reduce the
work of matching line colors to a separate legend.

<!-- ::chart-example id=55-indexed-multi-line height=480 -->

Prepare the indexed values in the application, state the baseline, and retain
the original values for exact-value disclosure. Use a stable series channel so
color, path grouping, focus, and updates agree on identity.
[Data and Channels](../concepts/data-and-channels.md) covers series grouping,
while [Legends and Color](../guides/legends-and-color.md) explains when a
separate legend is the better choice.

## Show a derived trend honestly

A moving average is a derived series, not a visual curve setting. Prepare the
rolling values with the public `rollingWindow` transform beside the definition, keep
the original time domain, and name the rolling window in surrounding text or a legend.

<!-- ::chart-example id=19-moving-average-line height=480 -->

Changing interpolation only changes the path between observations. It does not
perform smoothing or create evidence between samples. See
[Data Transforms](../reference/transforms.md) for rolling windows and reducers.

## Compare two boundaries at their exact crossings

A difference chart separates the intervals where a primary series is above or
below a comparison. Keep any rolling statistic or forecast calculation in data
preparation, then give both boundaries to `differenceY`:

```ts
differenceY(rows, {
  x: 'Date',
  y1: 'average',
  y2: 'Close',
  positiveFill: '#16a34a',
  negativeFill: '#dc2626',
  comparisonStroke: '#475569',
})
```

The mark finds each sign change, interpolates the exact crossing, and owns the
positive area, negative area, comparison line, and primary line. Application
code does not need to prepare sign runs or duplicate boundary rows.

The [Overview](../overview.md#a-chart-is-a-composition) shows the complete
rendered Apple closing-price example. See
[Difference Marks](../reference/marks/difference.md) for transposed
`differenceX`, gap behavior, fill suppression, lineage, and interaction.

## Add context with an interval

A Bollinger band combines a rolling center line with an interval derived from
local variation. The band is context for the observed series; it is not a
confidence interval unless the underlying calculation actually defines one.

<!-- ::chart-example id=22-bollinger-band height=480 -->

Compute the rolling statistics once and share those rows between the interval
and center line:

```ts
const bands = rollingWindow(aapl, {
  size: 20,
  orderBy: 'Date',
  anchor: 'end',
  partial: false,
  outputs: {
    meanClose: { value: 'Close', reduce: 'mean' },
    closeDeviation: { value: 'Close', reduce: deviation },
  },
})

areaY(bands, {
  x: 'Date',
  y1: (row) => row.meanClose - row.closeDeviation * 2,
  y2: (row) => row.meanClose + row.closeDeviation * 2,
})

lineY(bands, { x: 'Date', y: 'meanClose' })
```

The rolling-window length, estimator, and multiplier are authored statistical meaning.
The transform owns ordering and source lineage; the area owns interval
geometry. See [Line and Area Marks](../reference/marks/line-and-area.md) for
the channel contracts.

## Annotate selected observations

Annotations should explain a small number of meaningful points. Selecting the
minimum and maximum in data preparation makes the intent auditable and avoids
placing a text label on every observation.

<!-- ::chart-example id=58-select-extrema height=480 -->

Layer dots and text over the same scales rather than baking labels into a line
renderer. [Marks and Layering](../concepts/marks-and-layering.md) explains why
separate layers remain easier to update and extend.

## Production checks

- Preserve missing values when a gap is meaningful. The
  [Quick Start](../quick-start.md) demonstrates an explicit line gap.
- Use a temporal scale for dates and define the domain in application data
  semantics, as described in
  [Scales](../concepts/scales-and-d3.md).
- Preserve row IDs or unique positions across updates, and group series with
  `z`; supply `key` only when the mark cannot infer identity. See
  [Dynamic Data and Animation](../guides/dynamic-data-and-animation.md).
- Let automatic layout measure tick labels, then verify the smallest container
  in [Responsive Charts](../guides/responsive-charts.md).
- Use position, labels, or line treatment in addition to color when a
  distinction is essential. See [Accessibility](../guides/accessibility.md).
