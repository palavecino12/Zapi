description: Start with compact scales, upgrade individual mappings to D3 when their semantics require it, and keep responsive range ownership clear.
---

TanStack Charts accepts callable, copyable scale factories and instances. Start
with the exact compact scale entry that matches the mapping. Upgrade only the
axis, color, or radius mapping whose semantics require D3.

- **TanStack compact scales** cover numeric linear, categorical band and point,
  and ordinal mappings without a production D3 dependency.
- **D3** adds temporal, nonlinear, radial, interpolated, and statistical scale
  semantics plus optional shape, time, and spatial algorithms.
- **TanStack Charts** infers factory domains from mark channels, assigns
  responsive pixel ranges, lays out guides, compiles scenes, and renders them.

Compact and D3 scales implement the same chart-facing contract and can be used
in one definition. There is no hidden D3 umbrella import.

`@tanstack/charts` declares `d3-array`, `d3-shape`, `d3-geo`, `d3-delaunay`,
`d3-hexbin`, `d3-contour`, `d3-force`, `d3-sankey`, and `d3-hierarchy` because its
transforms, polar and D3 curve features, geo features, and optional spatial,
network, and hierarchy entries own those implementations. They are not peers
and require no `use` configuration. Bundlers tree-shake unused algorithms and
geometry, and exact feature subpaths remain available when an application
wants a narrower import.

## Start with compact scales

Install TanStack Charts for ordinary numeric and categorical charts:

```sh
pnpm add @tanstack/charts
```

Import one exact family:

```ts
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'
import { scalePoint } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/point'
import { scaleOrdinal } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/ordinal'
```

There is intentionally no aggregate `/scales` export. Each exact scale subpath
fits the same callable, `domain`, `range`, and `copy` contract consumed by
TanStack Charts.

The compact linear scale has numeric, two-stop domains and ranges. It supports
mapping, `invert`, `clamp`, `nice`, ticks, basic numeric tick formatting, and
copying. The categorical families support D3-compatible domain interning,
padding, alignment, rounding, bandwidth, unknown values, and copying.

Choose the smallest family that preserves the data's meaning:

| Mapping                                                    | Start with                           | Upgrade when                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Numeric x or y                                             | `@tanstack/charts/scales/linear`     | The mapping needs piecewise domains, nonnumeric output, or custom interpolation |
| Categories with width, such as bars                        | `@tanstack/charts/scales/band`       | The mapping needs behavior outside the documented compact band contract         |
| Categories without width, such as line or dot positions    | `@tanstack/charts/scales/point`      | The values must instead be spaced by elapsed time                               |
| Stable categorical colors                                  | `@tanstack/charts/scales/ordinal`    | The color mapping is sequential, diverging, quantile, quantize, or threshold    |
| Dates spaced by elapsed time and calendar-aware ticks      | `d3-scale` `scaleTime` or `scaleUtc` | —                                                                               |
| Logarithmic, power, symlog, square-root, or radial mapping | The corresponding `d3-scale` family  | —                                                                               |

`scaleBand` and `scalePoint` accept `Date` values as categories. They preserve
distinct dates and first-seen order, but they do not represent elapsed time. A
Friday and the following Monday occupy adjacent categorical positions. Use
`scaleTime` or `scaleUtc` when the weekend must occupy its real temporal span or
when the axis needs calendar-aware ticks.

An axis formatter does not by itself require a larger scale. Pass
`Intl.NumberFormat`, `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, or another application formatter to
the guide. Upgrade to D3 when the scale's own tick, interpolation, or domain
semantics are required.

## Upgrade one scale at a time

A definition does not need one scale implementation for every mapping. This
time-series chart upgrades x to D3 while keeping its ordinary numeric y scale
compact:

```ts
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { scaleUtc } from 'd3-scale'

const chart = defineChart({
  marks: [lineY(rows, { x: 'date', y: 'value' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scaleUtc, nice: true },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear, nice: true },
  },
})
```

Add `d3-scale` and `@types/d3-scale` because this source imports `scaleUtc`.
The compact scale entries ship their own declarations.

## Direct dependency ownership

If application source imports a `d3-*` module, declare that module and its
matching TypeScript package directly:

```sh
pnpm add d3-scale
pnpm add -D @types/d3-scale
```

Do not declare a D3 module merely because another package uses it internally. A
chart that directly upgrades only its temporal axis should declare only
`d3-scale`; bundlers should not retain unused shape, force, geo, zoom, or
hierarchy code. Apply the same direct-dependency rule when source imports
`d3-array`, `d3-shape`, or another granular D3 module.

This rule also applies when definitions live in framework component source.
The adapter mounts a definition; it does not own the D3 imports used to author
it.

`@tanstack/charts` declares `d3-array`, `d3-shape`, and `d3-geo` because its
numeric-bin and stack transforms, polar and D3 curve features, and geo features
own those implementations. They are not peers and require no `use`
configuration. Bundlers tree-shake unused algorithms and geometry, and exact
feature subpaths remain available when an application wants a narrower import.

## Capability map

Use the official D3 pages as the API reference for each algorithm. TanStack Charts documentation only describes how its output crosses the chart boundary.

An optional algorithm does not necessarily need final chart layout.
`treeLayout` and `forceLayout` produce semantic data-space coordinates, so
native `link`, `dot`, and `text` marks can map their output through ordinary
positional scales. Treemap topology depends on the final plot aspect ratio and
its padding is measured in pixels, so the exact `treemap` mark owns both the
responsive D3 layout and its downward-increasing screen coordinates. Sankey
column allocation, padding, and proportional link width also resolve in final
pixels; `sankeyDiagram` then composes ordinary marks over immutable node and
link rows. Density estimation and Delaunay geometry likewise run after scale
ranges resolve. Keep live force controllers in application state; the exact
Charts force entry owns deterministic static settlement only.

## Positional scales follow materialized dimensions

Every materialized positional dimension declares its scale:

```ts
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

const spec = {
  marks,
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scaleBand },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear, nice: true },
  },
}
```

Positionless marks use explicit null entries:

```ts
import { defineChart, frame } from '@tanstack/charts'

const borderOnlyChart = defineChart({
  marks: [frame()],
  scales: {
    x: null,
    y: null,
  },
})
```

A mark with x values requires a non-null x scale. A mark with y values requires
a non-null y scale. One-dimensional charts use `null` only for the unused
entry. The scale factory chooses the mapping; materialized mark channels
supply its domain.

## Factory domains come from marks

Pass the factory itself when the domain should cover the rendered data:

```ts
import { scalePoint } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/point'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

const chart = defineChart({
  marks: [lineY(rows, { x: 'month', y: 'value' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scalePoint },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear, nice: true },
  },
})
```

Continuous factories use the finite extent of their channels. Band and point
factories use distinct values in first-seen order. Bars and areas include zero
when they use an implicit zero baseline. Empty channels retain the factory's
native domain.

Return a scale from a zero-argument factory when it needs configuration before
domain inference:

```ts
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'

const x = {
  scale: () => scaleBand<string>().padding(0.16),
}
```

Use the axis `nice` option because nicening must happen after inference.

## Fixed domains remain application semantics

Pass a scale instance when the domain must not follow the rendered marks:

```ts
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { scaleUtc } from 'd3-scale'

const normalizedY = {
  scale: scaleLinear().domain([0, 1]),
}

const windowedX = {
  scale: scaleUtc().domain([windowStart, windowEnd]),
}
```

Be equally deliberate with:

- Whether a log scale is valid for all values
- Whether time is local or UTC
- Which categories exist when some are filtered out
- Whether multiple facets share a domain
- Whether a color domain must remain stable across sessions

The instance rule is the same for compact and D3 scales. Use the implementation
that owns the required mapping semantics, then configure the application-owned
domain on that instance.

## Responsive ranges belong to TanStack Charts

Do not assign pixel ranges to positional scales used by the chart:

```ts
const xScale = scaleUtc
const yScale = scaleLinear
```

For each scene, TanStack Charts:

1. Creates a factory scale or copies a configured instance.
2. Calculates the plot rectangle after guide measurement.
3. Assigns the current responsive pixel range to the copy.
4. Uses the copy for marks, ticks, grids, and interaction points.

The source scale is never mutated. This makes one module-level definition safe across container resizes, server rendering, multiple mounted hosts, and facets.

The `reverse` axis option reverses the responsive range without changing the domain:

```ts
const y = {
  scale: scaleLinear,
  reverse: true,
}
```

## Categorical scales and bandwidth

Pass the compact band-scale factory for categorical positions:

```ts
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'

const categoryScale = () =>
  scaleBand<string>().paddingInner(0.12).paddingOuter(0.06)
```

TanStack Charts applies the plot range, reads the scale bandwidth, and treats the mapped value as the center of the band for mark and interaction coordinates. Bars use the primary bandwidth by default.

For grouped bars, use `layout: group({ scale })`. The supplied band scale is
copied and its range is assigned within the primary band. Grouping is explicit;
the default length-channel geometry is stacked.

## Color scales

Omitting `color.scale` uses the chart theme’s ordinal palette for categorical group values:

```ts
const chart = defineChart({
  marks: [lineY(rows, { x: 'date', y: 'value', z: 'region' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: xScale },
    y: { scale: yScale },
  },
})
```

Use a configured compact ordinal scale for semantic stability:

```ts
import { scaleOrdinal } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/ordinal'

const regionColor = scaleOrdinal(
  ['North', 'South', 'West'],
  ['#2563eb', '#f97316', '#10b981'],
)

const chart = defineChart({
  marks: [lineY(rows, { x: 'date', y: 'value', z: 'region' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: xScale },
    y: { scale: yScale },
  },

  color: {
    scale: regionColor,
    legend: colorLegend({ label: 'Region' }),
  },
})
```

The color scale is copied before use. Unlike positional scales, its range is semantic color output and remains the range you configured.

Use a factory when a custom color mapping should infer its domain:

```ts
const color = {
  scale: () => scaleOrdinal<string, string>().range(['#2563eb', '#f97316']),
}
```

Upgrade the color mapping to `d3-scale` when numeric values need sequential or
diverging interpolation, or when authored policy needs quantile, quantize, or
threshold bins. `d3-scale-chromatic` supplies optional color schemes; it is a
separate direct dependency when imported.

## Full D3 scale semantics

Replace only the compact factory whose contract is insufficient. Import that
factory directly from `d3-scale`:

- `scaleUtc` and `scaleTime` preserve elapsed-time spacing and calendar ticks.
- `scaleLog`, `scalePow`, and `scaleSymlog` express nonlinear quantitative
  comparisons.
- `scaleSqrt` and `scaleRadial` map magnitude to symbol radius or area.
- `scaleSequential`, `scaleDiverging`, `scaleQuantile`, `scaleQuantize`, and
  `scaleThreshold` express quantitative or stepped color policy.
- D3 `scaleLinear` supports piecewise domains and ranges, nonnumeric range
  interpolation, custom interpolators, and the rest of the complete D3 linear
  contract.

The factory-versus-instance and responsive-range rules do not change after an
upgrade.

## Radius scales

`dot` treats `r` as pixels unless `rScale` is supplied:

```ts
import { scaleSqrt } from 'd3-scale'

dot(rows, {
  x: 'revenue',
  y: 'retention',
  r: 'accounts',
  rScale: {
    scale: () => scaleSqrt().range([3, 24]),
  },
})
```

The radius factory infers `[0, maximum]` from `r`. A configured scale instance
still keeps its explicit domain. D3 owns the radius mapping; the chart owns dot
geometry and rendering.

## Curves

Straight lines and areas do not need `d3-shape`. Opt into a curve only when the design requires it:

```ts
import { curveMonotoneX } from 'd3-shape'
import { d3Curve, lineY } from '@tanstack/charts'

lineY(rows, {
  x: 'date',
  y: 'value',
  curve: d3Curve(curveMonotoneX),
})
```

`d3Curve` adapts a D3 curve factory to the small line-and-area curve contract. Importing it is explicit so a straight chart does not need the shape path.

Horizontal `areaX` marks use the separate `d3AreaXCurve` bridge from `@tanstack/charts/d3/area-x`.

## Transforms produce rows

TanStack Charts includes typed, data-first helpers for common transforms:

```ts
import { binX } from '@tanstack/charts/transform/bin'

const histogram = binX(rows, {
  value: 'value',
  thresholds: 20,
})
```

Pass the result to `rect`, `barY`, `lineY`, `dot`, or a custom mark. The helpers
use compact row-oriented kernels or isolated granular D3 implementations while
retaining typed source lineage. Domain-specific D3 transforms still work
directly; no adapter or library-owned series shape is required. Keep
substantial transforms beside the definition and memoize them through
application reactivity.

The same rule applies to stacks, pies, hierarchies, force layouts, and
server-prepared intervals: preserve the useful output as typed rows, then map
it through mark channels. A responsive geographic projection instead belongs
in `geoShape`'s projection factory because its pixel range depends on the final
plot bounds.

## Pixel-to-value inversion

`brushX`, `continuousCursor`, `zoomX`, and free `cursorHost` bindings own
final-scale inversion for their normal gestures. A custom crop or gesture can
read the same optional inverse from the resolved scene scale:

```ts
const scene = host.getScene()
const invertX = scene.scales.x.invert
if (!invertX) throw new Error('This interaction requires an invertible x scale')

const selectedDate = invertX(pointerX)
```

For a normal continuous y axis, the resolved scale already owns its reversed
pixel range:

```ts
const invertY = scene.scales.y.invert
if (!invertY) throw new Error('This interaction requires an invertible y scale')

const selectedValue = invertY(pointerY)
```

Apply the application’s precision policy after inversion. For example, round a day-based selection with a D3 time interval or round a currency threshold to the supported increment. Pixels do not imply semantic precision.

A free cursor needs no `valueAt` callback for ordinary numeric or temporal
axes. Provide one only to replace inversion with explicit snapping, rounding,
or another semantic mapping. Missing and non-invertible scales require that
override.

When the application owns a custom gesture, disable the native nearest-point
focus strategy if the two interactions would conflict. See
[Interactions and Selections](../guides/interactions-and-selections.md).

## Log-scale example

```ts group=log-scale env=charts file=/src/chart.ts entry
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { scaleLog } from 'd3-scale'
import { defineChart, dot } from '@tanstack/charts'
import { flare, type FlareRow } from './data'

type SizedFlareRow = FlareRow & { size: number }

const rows = flare.filter((row): row is SizedFlareRow => row.size !== null)

export default defineChart({
  marks: [
    dot(rows, {
      x: 'size',
      y: (row) => row.name.split('.').length - 1,
      key: 'name',
      r: 4,
      fill: '#2563eb',
    }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: {
      scale: scaleLog().domain([200, 30_000]),
      grid: true,
      axis: { label: 'Class size' },
    },
    y: {
      scale: scaleLinear,
      grid: true,
      axis: { label: 'Hierarchy depth' },
    },
  },
})
```

```ts group=log-scale file=/src/data.ts collapsed
export interface FlareRow {
  name: string
  size: number | null
}

export const flare: readonly FlareRow[] = [
  { name: 'flare.analytics.cluster', size: 3938 },
  { name: 'flare.analytics.graph', size: 10_871 },
  { name: 'flare.analytics.optimization', size: 5731 },
  { name: 'flare.display', size: 12_867 },
  { name: 'flare.query', size: 2779 },
  { name: 'flare.unresolved', size: null },
]
```

This chart upgrades only x. Install `d3-scale` and `@types/d3-scale` for
`scaleLog`; the ordinary numeric y mapping remains compact.

## Custom scales are the final extension

Use `ChartScale` only when neither a compact nor D3 callable scale can express
the mapping. Its resolver owns the complete domain, finite mapping, ticks,
formatting, bandwidth, and response to the supplied chart range. A custom scale
is appropriate for context-aware mappings that need the resolved chart options,
not as a wrapper around an existing compact or D3 scale.

See
[Custom Extensions](../reference/custom-extensions.md#custom-positional-scales)
for the resolver contract.

[Scales, Guides, and Color Reference](../reference/scales-guides-and-color.md).
