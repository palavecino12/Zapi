description: Give charts useful names, keyboard-equivalent interaction, reduced motion, redundant encodings, and exact-value alternatives.

Accessibility is part of the chart contract, not a final annotation pass.
TanStack Charts provides named SVG and Canvas surfaces plus shared focus
primitives; the application still owns the surrounding explanation, controls,
and exact-value alternative.

## Name the chart

Every DOM host and framework adapter requires `ariaLabel`:

```tsx
<Chart
  definition={definition}
  ariaLabel="Weekly downloads for three packages"
/>
```

Use `ariaDescription` when the reader needs context that is not already
visible nearby:

```tsx
<Chart
  definition={definition}
  ariaLabel="Weekly downloads for three packages"
  ariaDescription="Values are seven-day totals. Missing weeks are rendered as gaps."
/>
```

The SVG renderer emits an image role, a chart roledescription, and a `<desc>`
when a description is supplied. The Canvas renderer places the same image role,
name, roledescription, description, and tab index on its root while keeping all
five canvas descendants `aria-hidden`. Do not put instructions, conclusions,
and all underlying data into one enormous accessible name.

## Preserve semantic context outside the surface

A chart should usually be accompanied by:

- a visible heading;
- a short statement of what is being compared;
- units and time range;
- a source note when relevant;
- a summary or table when exact values matter.

Use normal HTML for this content. It is easier to navigate, select, translate,
and print than text embedded in SVG.

## Keyboard focus and selection

Chart-owned focus supports pointer and keyboard navigation over chart points.
Leave `keyboard` enabled when a chart is interactive. Focus callbacks expose
the same typed `ChartPoint` data regardless of input method.

If the application replaces chart-owned focus with a brush, zoom, editor, or rich
overlay:

- provide semantic buttons, sliders, inputs, or table rows;
- keep visible focus styles;
- expose current state in text;
- support Escape when an interaction can be cancelled;
- use live announcements sparingly for meaningful committed changes;
- make touch targets at least 44 CSS pixels where practical.

The [Interactions and Selections](./interactions-and-selections.md) guide
defines the ownership boundary.

`interactiveColorLegend` uses native browser buttons with `aria-pressed`, a
named group, 44-pixel minimum targets, and stable focus across controlled
updates. Static SVG output keeps only a visual fallback, so pair exported
charts with text or a table when series visibility must remain actionable.

`brushX` exposes its ordered handles as horizontal sliders when `values` is
provided. Arrow keys move one authored value, Home and End move to the allowed
range edge, and Escape restores the range from the active pointer gesture.
Give both handles distinct names and format their semantic values. The DOM
overlay works with SVG and Canvas hosts; static SVG and React Native need an
application-owned range input for equivalent operation.

`continuousCursor` paints an unsnapped pointer guide but does not expose that
presentation-only overlay as a keyboard task. Pair its controlled x/y position
with named sliders or inputs and visible status text. Escape clears a visible
cursor through the behavior; the semantic controls should update the same
controlled position. Static SVG and React Native retain accepted guide paint
but still need those application-owned controls for operation.

`handleX` exposes one named horizontal slider. Left or Down moves to the
previous authored value, Right or Up moves to the next, and Home and End move
to the candidate endpoints. Its `format` result becomes `aria-valuetext`; the
pointer target is 44 pixels high by default. Escape restores the gesture
origin while a pointer or touch drag is active. Static SVG and React Native
retain the accepted handle paint but need an application-owned semantic input.

`zoomX` exposes one named plot surface with visible focus. Plus and minus zoom,
the arrow keys pan, Home resets, and Escape cancels an active gesture. Wheel
input is captured only while that surface is focused by default. For scrolling
dashboards, `wheelActivation: 'modifier'` lets Control+wheel or Command+wheel
act immediately under the pointer while every unmodified wheel keeps scrolling
the page. `wheelActivation: 'always'` deliberately captures every wheel over
the plot. Keep a visible Reset button and current-window text bound to the same
controlled window. Static SVG and React Native render the accepted window but
need application-owned semantic zoom controls.

## Never rely on color alone

Pair semantic color with at least one other signal:

- direct labels;
- shape or stroke pattern;
- ordering;
- position;
- text in a legend or linked table;
- selected outlines and `aria-pressed` state.

Check contrast against the actual application background in both light and
dark modes. The theme cannot infer whether an arbitrary data color is
accessible.

## Motion

The default SVG tween and optional `motion()` renderer respect
`prefers-reduced-motion` by default. Keep `respectReducedMotion: true` unless
an application has a stronger accessible motion policy. Reduced motion snaps
entrance, update, and focus-state changes to final geometry without scheduling
animation frames.

Motion should explain continuity between states. It should not:

- delay access to current values;
- loop without a pause control;
- move the focus target away from keyboard users;
- encode the only evidence of a change.

See [Dynamic Data and Animation](./dynamic-data-and-animation.md) for the
lightweight tween and optional spring renderer boundaries.

## Tooltips are supplemental

The built-in tooltip exposes its structured rows through a polite status region.
It is not a replacement for a label, axis, legend, or data table. Essential
information must remain available without hovering.

For complex framework content, use the adapter's tooltip-body composition
surface. Its transient body is inert, so a display-only nested chart can remain
visible but does not enter the focus or accessibility order. Render controls
only while `pinned` is true. The pinned surface has non-modal dialog semantics,
Escape and `dismiss()` close it, and focus returns to the chart when dismissal
starts inside the body. Controls still need an intentional tab order and
accessible names.

Use `tooltip.visibility: 'pinned'` when no transient surface should be
announced. Focus and pinned mark styling remain available, while the tooltip
element and framework body mount only after activation.

## Linked table pattern

For analytical and operational charts, a linked table gives readers exact
values and a familiar navigation surface. Selection state should be shared
semantically, rather than inferred from DOM nodes.

Use `keyedSelection` and `whenSelected` for chart activation and selected
geometry. Keep the semantic HTML table, status announcement, and clear control
in the application, bound to the same controlled selected key.

## Testing checklist

Test the finished application, not only the SVG or Canvas element:

1. Navigate the page and chart with a keyboard.
2. Confirm visible focus and a logical navigation order.
3. Operate selection, pinning, zoom, and editing without a pointer.
4. Verify focus and selection persist correctly after data updates.
5. Enable reduced motion.
6. Test light, dark, forced-colors, and increased text size.
7. Inspect the accessible name and description.
8. Confirm exact values are available outside hover-only UI.
9. Confirm status and errors are not encoded only by color.
10. Use a screen reader on the complete task flow.

Automated checks can catch missing names and invalid roles, but they cannot
decide whether the representation communicates the right thing.
