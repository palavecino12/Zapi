description: Export accessible chart SVG or browser-rendered raster images while preserving dimensions, styling, and resource identity.

TanStack Charts' built-in export helpers have three paths:

- render a `ChartScene` directly to an SVG string;
- serialize an SVG that is already mounted in a browser;
- rasterize a mounted SVG or Canvas chart.

Choose based on whether export needs computed browser styles.

## Render a scene to SVG

`renderChartSvg` is deterministic and DOM-free:

```ts
import { createChartScene, renderChartSvg } from '@tanstack/charts'

const scene = createChartScene(definition, {
  width: 960,
  height: 540,
})

const svg = renderChartSvg(scene, {
  ariaLabel: 'Quarterly revenue',
  ariaDescription: 'Revenue rose in three of four quarters.',
  idPrefix: 'quarterly-revenue',
})
```

This direct serializer paints the complete renderer-neutral scene as SVG. It
does not run mark-level surface composition, so it can provide a vector
snapshot of a definition that selects Canvas when mounted.

For a responsive definition, create a runtime with its datum, x-value, and
y-value generics, then call `render(...)` with the definition and explicit
size. See [Runtime and Scene](../reference/runtime-and-scene.md#createchartruntime)
and [SSR and Hydration](./ssr-and-hydration.md).

Use explicit export dimensions. Responsive browser dimensions are a display
policy, not a reproducible file size.

## Serialize a mounted chart

The export subpath copies a mounted chart and inlines presentation properties
that depend on CSS:

```ts
import { downloadChartSvg, serializeChartSvg } from '@tanstack/charts/export'

const serialized = serializeChartSvg(chartContainer, {
  width: 1200,
  height: 675,
})

downloadChartSvg(chartContainer, 'quarterly-revenue.svg', {
  width: 1200,
  height: 675,
})
```

The target may be the chart SVG or an ancestor containing `svg.ts-chart`.
Focus decoration is omitted by default; set `includeFocus: true` when it is
part of the intended artifact. This includes authored `whenFocused` geometry,
the primary focus ring, and the currently painted crosshair or controlled
cursor guide.

## Export PNG, JPEG, or WebP

Raster export is browser-only and is isolated behind the same export subpath:

```ts
import { downloadChartImage, renderChartImage } from '@tanstack/charts/export'

const blob = await renderChartImage(chartContainer, {
  width: 1200,
  height: 675,
  scale: 2,
  background: '#ffffff',
  type: 'image/png',
})

await downloadChartImage(chartContainer, 'quarterly-revenue.png', {
  scale: 2,
  background: '#ffffff',
})
```

`scale` controls raster density, not chart layout. A 1200 × 675 chart at scale
2 produces a 2400 × 1350 canvas while retaining the 1200 × 675 visual
coordinate system.

## Export a Canvas chart

Pass the Canvas root or an ancestor containing it to the same
`renderChartImage` or `downloadChartImage` functions. Without focus, the
exporter draws the stable base bitmap at the requested dimensions and scale.
Set `includeFocus: true` to composite the live background, focus underlay,
ordinary scene, and focus overlay layers in that order. Crosshair guides use
the same underlay and overlay canvases.

Canvas focus is painted on underlay and overlay canvases so pointer movement
does not repaint the base scene. Applications that need only the raw base
bitmap may also call `toBlob()` or `toDataURL()` on
`CanvasChartSurface.canvas`; it contains the chart background and ordinary
scene but no transient focus. `backgroundCanvas`, `focusUnderCanvas`,
`sceneCanvas`, and `focusCanvas` expose the modeled live layers. Unlike
SVG serialization, Canvas export does not retain vector geometry, accessible
markup, or independently styleable nodes.

## Export a mixed SVG and Canvas chart

Pass the mixed chart root or its host to `renderChartImage` or
`downloadChartImage`. The exporter composites every SVG and Canvas child
surface in visual order. Set `includeFocus: true` to include the live focus
layers in the same positions used by the mounted chart.

`serializeChartSvg` and `downloadChartSvg` reject a mixed root. A mixed chart
contains raster pixels, so a pure vector SVG would either omit those marks or
embed a raster image. Use the raster export path when any mounted mark selects
Canvas.

## Theme and resource policy

Export the theme intended for the artifact. A chart following application dark
mode should usually receive an explicit light theme and background for a
document or print workflow.

Gradients and clips require stable resource IDs. Supply `idPrefix` when
rendering multiple chart exports into the same document. If a custom SVG
renderer is in use, it must preserve the scene's gradients, accessibility
metadata, and scoped IDs.

## Security and portability

Chart text is escaped by the SVG renderer. Custom renderers and custom tooltip
HTML remain application-owned.

Before exporting a chart that references external images, fonts, or CSS,
decide whether the consumer can reach those resources. Self-contained SVG
needs embedded or inlined assets.

## Export checklist

- File dimensions are explicit.
- The export theme and background are intentional.
- The accessible name and description describe the exported state.
- Resource IDs are scoped.
- Fonts and external resources are portable.
- Focus decoration is included only when meaningful.
- Raster scale is chosen for the target medium.
- A Canvas or mixed export intentionally includes or excludes focus layers.

See [Rendering and Export](../reference/rendering-and-export.md) for every
function and option.
