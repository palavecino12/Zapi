title: Dynamic Data and Animation
description: Recreate memoized definitions when application values change and animate keyed geometry safely.
---

Definition identity is the application update boundary. A framework memo
captures the current data and options; Charts rebuilds the scene when that
definition changes or when the chart surface changes size.

## React

```tsx
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

function RankingChart({ rows, metric, accent }: Props) {
  const definition = useMemo(() => {
    const ranked = rows
      .map((row) => ({ label: row.label, value: row[metric] }))
      .sort((left, right) => right.value - left.value)

    return defineChart({
      svgAnimation: { duration: 280, easing: 'ease-out' },
      chart: ({ width }) => ({
        marks: [
          barX(ranked, {
            x: 'value',
            y: 'label',
            fill: accent,
          }),
        ],
        scales: {
          x: {
            scale: scaleLinear,
            nice: true,
            axis: { ticks: { count: width < 420 ? 4 : 7 } },
          },
          y: {
            scale: () => scaleBand<string>().padding(0.1),
          },
        },
      }),
    })
  }, [rows, metric, accent])

  return <Chart definition={definition} ariaLabel="Revenue ranking" />
}
```

Use the framework's native equivalent: `computed`, `createMemo`, `$derived`,
Angular `computed`, or Octane `useMemo`.

## Vanilla

```ts
host.update({
  ...options,
  definition: createRankingDefinition(nextRows, nextMetric, nextAccent),
})
```

## Stable keys

Built-in marks first use an explicit `key`, then a unique `datum.id`, then a
unique nested `datum.data.id`. Marks can also infer identity from semantic
positional channels:

```ts
barX(rows, {
  x: 'value',
  y: 'label',
})
```

Here `barX` uses the unique `y` value when rows have no `id`. `barY` uses `x`;
`lineY` and `areaY` use `x`; `areaX` uses `y`; rects and cells use their x/y
interval tuple. Dots and text try x, then y, then their x/y tuple. Inference is
scoped to each group and falls back to array position when a candidate is
incomplete or duplicated. Development builds warn once for each affected mark
instance.

Supply `key` when the inferred value is not the entity's identity or can
change independently of it. Stable identity preserves surviving SVG elements,
focused points, and transition continuity.

## Lightweight SVG tweening

`svgAnimation` accepts `true` or:

- `duration`: milliseconds;
- `easing`: `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`, or a
  function from normalized progress to normalized progress;
- `respectReducedMotion`: defaults to `true`;
- `resize`: defaults to `false`, so responsive relayout does not repeatedly
  restart animation.

Numeric geometry and compatible path data interpolate. Entering and exiting
nodes reconcile by key. If an update interrupts a transition, it begins from
the geometry currently painted on screen.

Static SVG, server rendering, and `createChartScene` do not include animation.

Use this path when a small default-SVG tween is enough. It has no spring
solver, definition-local timing cascade, entrance choreography, or retained
velocity.

## Optional tween and spring motion

Use `motion()` when animation quality is part of the chart contract:

```ts
import { scaleUtc } from 'd3-scale'
import { motion } from '@tanstack/charts/motion'
import { stagger } from '@tanstack/charts/motion/definition'
import { mountChartRenderer } from '@tanstack/charts/renderer'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

const definition = defineChart({
  motion: {
    path: 'morph',
    ...stagger({ each: 35, roles: 'line', by: 'series' }),
  },
  marks: [
    lineY(rows, {
      x: 'date',
      y: 'actual',
      key: 'id',
    }),
    lineY(rows, {
      x: 'date',
      y: 'forecast',
      key: 'id',
      motion: { transition: { type: 'spring', mass: 1.25 } },
    }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scaleUtc },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear },
  },
})

const host = mountChartRenderer(container, {
  definition,
  renderer: motion({
    transition: { type: 'spring', stiffness: 170, damping: 18, mass: 1 },
  }),
  width: 640,
  height: 360,
  ariaLabel: 'Actual and forecast revenue',
})
```

Each host has one animation owner. The default SVG renderer uses `svgAnimation`.
When `motion()` is the renderer, it ignores `svgAnimation` and uses motion
declarations from the definition. A `motion` declaration configures the motion
renderer; it does not select it.

Motion declarations can live on the chart, a mark, an axis, its ticks, tick
labels, or axis label. A callback can specialize `enter`, `update`, and `exit`
by series or datum:

```ts
barY(rows, {
  x: 'month',
  y: 'revenue',
  key: 'id',
  motion(context) {
    if (context.phase === 'enter') {
      return { delay: context.datumIndex * 35 }
    }
    if (context.datum?.status === 'forecast') {
      return { transition: { type: 'tween', duration: 240 } }
    }
  },
})
```

Same-type partial transitions inherit omitted properties. Springs use physical
`stiffness`, `damping`, and `mass`; duration is not a spring parameter. Rapid
retargeting preserves the currently painted value and velocity. Keyed
interaction points move with the presentation geometry rather than jumping to
the next scene.

A `crosshair` is also keyed focus presentation. With the motion renderer, its
rules, bands, labels, and marker retain DOM identity and spring velocity while
focus retargets. Default SVG, Canvas, and native surfaces paint the same guide
at its current target without importing the browser motion runtime.

`stagger()` contributes only a context-aware delay, so it composes with
transition and path fields through normal object spread. Spring updates always
retarget immediately; an update delay is ignored so incoming momentum cannot
freeze. Use delays for spring enter/exit choreography or any tween phase.

The renderer grows entering Cartesian bars, lines, and areas from their
semantic baseline; grows radial paths from the polar center; sweeps arcs
through their authored angle; staggers bar entrances; morphs compatible
numeric SVG geometry; and keeps removed keys painted through their exit
transition. Authored delay replaces automatic staggering for that target.

`motion()` respects reduced motion and does not animate resize-only updates by
default. It adopts server-rendered SVG without replaying entrance motion by
default; pass `initial: 'always'` to replay entrance motion after hydration.
Static SVG and Canvas accept the same definitions but paint the final state.

See the [Motion reference](../reference/motion.md) for the complete cascade,
types, focus-state transitions, compatibility limits, and standalone spring
sampler.

See [Themes and Motion examples](../examples/themes-and-motion.md) for complete
cards that separate keyed chart motion from controls, labels, and palette CSS.

## Streaming

For high-rate data:

1. Keep source history outside the chart if the product needs it.
2. Capture a bounded visible window or encoded representation.
3. Preserve keys for rows that survive the roll.
4. Keep viewport state controlled.
5. Coalesce upstream work when only the latest state matters.

For a scrolling trace, keep enough overscan before the visible x-domain to
cover the largest expected update batch, enable `clip`, and use a rolling path
contract:

```ts
const definition = defineChart({
  motion: {
    path: {
      update: 'rolling',
      x: 'shift',
      y: 'reproject',
      fallback: 'snap',
    },
    transition: { type: 'tween', duration: sampleInterval, easing: 'linear' },
  },
  marks,
  scales: {
    x: null,
    y: null,
  },
})
```

The keyed retained window moves as one affine path. `y: 'reproject'` keeps that
motion valid while a continuous y-domain changes. A failed rolling invariant
snaps instead of occasionally becoming a different interpolation. Set
`fallback: 'morph'` only when path interpolation is intentional. A valid update
that arrives during another roll composes from the transform currently painted
on screen.

Keep `viewport.translate` at zero on both the previous and target scene during
a rolling update. A nonzero transient viewport translation makes the rolling
contract fail and uses its configured fallback. Commit the viewport domain and
reset the translation before applying the next live-data window. Keep plot
margins fixed and prefer linear segments so appending a sample cannot recompute
a visible curve tangent.

The final definition passed to `host.update` is applied synchronously.
