title: Interactions and Selections
description: Build controlled cursors, linked selections, brushes, zooming, scrolling, timelines, and editors around semantic chart state.
---

TanStack Charts owns datum focus, selection, crosshair presentation, optional
cursor bindings, and the mechanics of explicitly imported chart controls. The
application owns accepted semantic values, shared controller identity, and
product policy.

This boundary keeps the default host small and lets applications use
battle-tested interaction controllers only when needed.

## Choose the owner

Use native chart focus for:

- nearest-point inspection;
- grouped axis tooltips;
- snapped crosshairs;
- synchronized focus cursors;
- keyboard point navigation;
- point activation.

Use a first-party controlled chart control for:

- categorical series visibility through `interactiveColorLegend`;
- semantic point selection through `keyedSelection`;
- an unsnapped numeric or temporal plot position through `continuousCursor`;
- one ordered scale value through `handleX`;
- a scale-bound horizontal range through `brushX`;
- a controlled numeric or temporal x window through `zoomX`;
- other controls that explicitly accept a `ControlledSignal`.

Use controlled application state for:

- shared cursor-controller identity and programmatic cursor values;
- accepted brush, zoom, and pan domains;
- focus-and-context windows;
- synchronized-view layout and domain policy;
- scrollable resource lanes;
- playback timing and play/pause controls;
- editable intervals;
- rich pinned tooltips.

See [Tooltips and Focus](./tooltips-and-focus.md) for chart-owned datum inspection.

## Cursors and crosshairs

`crosshair` is presentation; `createChartCursor` is state. A crosshair without
a cursor binding follows the chart's local `ChartFocusState`:

```ts
import { crosshair } from '@tanstack/charts/crosshair'

const definition = defineChart({
  marks: [
    lineY(rows, { x: 'date', y: 'value' }),
    crosshair({ x: { label: true }, y: false }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scaleUtc },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear },
  },

  focus: 'group-x',
  maxFocusDistance: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,
})
```

This gives pointer and keyboard users one snapped vertical guide. It does not
create a point, change the focus strategy, or require an SVG overlay.

On a categorical axis, `x: { band: true }` or `y: { band: true }` replaces
that axis rule with a cursor band sized from the resolved scale bandwidth. A
band options object controls inset, radius, fill, stroke, and opacity. Use
separate crosshair marks when the band should paint below the data and the
other axis rule should paint above it. Zero-bandwidth axes emit no band.

### Synchronize focus by value

Share one controller between definitions when several browser or React Native
charts should resolve the same semantic value through their own scales:

```ts
import { createChartCursor, cursorHost } from '@tanstack/charts/cursor'

const sharedDate = createChartCursor<Date, number>()
const cursor = {
  use: cursorHost,
  controller: sharedDate,
  mode: 'focus' as const,
  match: 'x' as const,
  pin: true,
}

const throughputDefinition = defineChart(throughputSpec, { cursor })
const errorsDefinition = defineChart(errorsSpec, { cursor })
```

Focus mode publishes `anchor: 'value'`. Each chart resolves that date to its
own local point and focus group; no chart copies another chart's pixels.
Pointer, keyboard, restored, and programmatic sources remain visible in the
shared state. `match` defaults to `xy` and can be `x` or `y`. Focus state may
also carry an optional local `origin` point identity to break ties between
repeated equal values, including facets. A stable `key` plus `markId` survives
data reordering; `datumIndex` disambiguates duplicate keys. A chart ignores the
origin when its key and mark do not exist locally and resolves from the
portable semantic `value` and preferred `group`.

### Track free coordinates

Free mode updates without selecting a datum. The host stores normalized plot
coordinates and derives semantic values through each resolved scale's inverse:

```ts
const freeCursor = createChartCursor<Date, number>()
const xScale = scaleUtc().domain([start, end])
const yScale = scaleLinear().domain([0, maximum])

const definition = defineChart({
  marks: [
    dot(rows, { x: 'date', y: 'value' }),
    crosshair({
      x: { label: true },
      y: { label: true },
      marker: true,
    }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: xScale },
    y: { scale: yScale },
  },

  cursor: {
    use: cursorHost,
    controller: freeCursor,
    mode: 'free',
    pin: true,
  },
})
```

The resolved final ranges own inversion, including a reversed y range. Add an
axis `valueAt` only to replace that default with observed-value snapping,
rounding, or another semantic policy. A missing or non-invertible scale
requires such an override; returning `undefined` keeps that axis
coordinate-only.

Set semantic state directly when another control owns the cursor:

```ts
freeCursor.setState({
  anchor: 'value',
  value: { x: selectedDate, y: selectedValue },
  source: 'programmatic',
  pinned: true,
})

freeCursor.setState(null)
```

With `pin: true`, click or tap pins the current cursor and another activation
dismisses it. Browser focus mode also supports Enter, Space, and Escape. React
Chart-owned focus exposes equivalent activate and escape accessibility
actions. Free mode has no invented keyboard or accessibility point order; pair
it with labeled date/number inputs, a range control, or textual status when
arbitrary values are part of the reader's task. The crosshair itself is visual
and `aria-hidden`.

Browser renderer hosts and React Native `Chart` both bind focus and free
cursors. They share controller state, semantic focus resolution, coordinate
projection, and crosshair presentation; only their event plumbing differs.
React Native uses responder gestures and accessibility actions instead of DOM
pointer and key events.

Application code imports `createChartCursor`, `cursorHost`, and cursor state
types from `@tanstack/charts/cursor`. Every cursor binding supplies
`use: cursorHost`, keeping cursor policy out of charts that do not opt in. The
adapter-facing
`@tanstack/charts/cursor/host` entry contains the platform-neutral projection
and focus helpers used to implement a host; ordinary chart definitions do not
need it.

## Controlled signals

A controlled signal is the boundary between application-owned semantic state
and a chart-owned behavior:

```ts
import { controlledSignal } from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/signal'

const visible = controlledSignal(visibleSeries, (next, { reason }) => {
  setVisibleSeries(next)
})
```

It is only a typed snapshot and callback. It does not create a chart store,
subscription, or second lifecycle. Rebuild the definition with the accepted
value, as with a controlled form input. The behavior owns interaction details;
the application owns persistence and policy.

## Controlled keyed selection

Use `keyedSelection` when chart activation and application UI share one stable
datum key:

```ts
import { defineChart, dot } from '@tanstack/charts'
import { controlledSignal } from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/signal'
import { keyedSelection, whenSelected } from '@tanstack/charts/selection'

const selection = keyedSelection<Observation, string, number, number>({
  selected: controlledSignal(selectedId, (next, { reason }) => {
    setSelectedId(next)
  }),
  key: (datum) => datum.id,
})

const definition = defineChart({
  marks: [
    dot(observations, {
      id: 'observations',
      x: 'flipperLength',
      y: 'bodyMass',
      key: 'id',
    }),
    whenSelected(
      dot(observations, {
        id: 'selected-observation',
        x: 'flipperLength',
        y: 'bodyMass',
        key: 'id',
        r: 7,
        strokeWidth: 2,
      }),
      selection,
    ),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: null,
    y: null,
  },
  selection,
})
```

Click, Enter, and Space propose the selected key through the controlled signal.
A blank-surface click proposes `null` when a selection exists. The change
reason distinguishes `select` from `clear` and records whether activation came
from `pointer` or `keyboard`. A nullish key makes that point non-selectable.

`whenSelected` is an ordinary authored mark filtered after scale domains
resolve. Its complete data and channels still contribute to the domains, but
only geometry whose point matches the selected key is painted. The filtered
overlay is decorative: it emits no second focus or activation point. If one
logical point owns several scene fragments, every matching fragment remains.

Focus and selection are independent. Focus can move without changing the
controlled key, and a selected overlay does not replace the normal focus ring.
Keep semantic tables, status announcements, clear buttons, persistence, and
product-specific key policy in application UI. Those controls can update the
same selected value used to rebuild the definition.

## Continuous cursor

Use `continuousCursor` for an arbitrary x/y plot position that must not snap to
a datum:

```ts
import { defineChart, dot } from '@tanstack/charts'
import {
  continuousCursor,
  type ContinuousCursorChange,
  type ContinuousCursorPosition,
} from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/cursor'
import { controlledSignal } from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/signal'

type Position = ContinuousCursorPosition<number, number>

const definition = defineChart({
  marks: [dot(rows, { x: 'horsepower', y: 'economy' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: horsepowerScale },
    y: { scale: economyScale },
  },

  controls: [
    continuousCursor({
      position: controlledSignal<
        Position | null,
        ContinuousCursorChange<number, number>
      >(cursorPosition, (next, { reason }) => {
        if (reason.type === 'commit' || reason.type === 'clear') {
          setCursorPosition(next)
        }
      }),
      xLabel: { format: (value) => `HP ${value.toFixed(1)}` },
      yLabel: { format: (value) => `MPG ${value.toFixed(1)}` },
    }),
  ],
})
```

Both scales must be invertible numeric or temporal scales. The behavior uses
their final resolved ranges, including a reversed y range, and clamps values to
the plot. This is the same default inversion used by a free `cursorHost`
binding. Rules and the marker are enabled by default. Axis labels are opt-in.

A `null` controlled position leaves pointer previews transient. Click or tap
proposes a `commit`; accepting its non-null position pins the cursor. A second
activation or Escape proposes `clear`. Pointer leave and cancellation clear an
unpinned preview. `ContinuousCursorChange` distinguishes `preview`, `commit`,
and `clear`, records pointer, touch, or keyboard source, and preserves the
origin position.

The SVG and Canvas DOM hosts replace the static scene fallback with a host
overlay, so pointer movement repaints the guide without rebuilding the chart
scene. Static SVG and React Native paint an accepted non-null position but do
not provide pointer input. Pair the cursor with semantic sliders or inputs and
visible status text for keyboard and nonvisual operation. Those controls can
write the same application-owned position.

## Custom interaction loop

Use this lower-level loop when no first-party behavior owns the gesture:

1. Render the definition from semantic state.
2. Read `scene.chart` and resolved scales in `onRender`.
3. Convert pointer geometry into semantic values.
4. Clamp, snap, or validate those values as product policy.
5. Update application state.
6. Let the next definition produce the scene.

Do not mutate SVG geometry directly and then attempt to reconcile application
state afterward.

## Controlled point inspection

Use the chart's interaction controller when the application owns pointer
timing but still wants the definition's focus strategy, focus marks, and
tooltip. Long-press inspection is one example:

```tsx
let interaction: ChartInteractionController<Row, Date, number> | undefined

const definition = defineChart({
  marks: [lineY(rows, { x: 'date', y: 'value', key: 'id' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scaleUtc() },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear() },
  },

  focus: 'nearest-x',
  pointer: false,
  tooltip,
})

const chart = (
  <Chart
    definition={definition}
    ariaLabel="Portfolio history"
    onRender={(context) => {
      interaction = context.interaction
    }}
  />
)

function inspect(clientX: number, clientY: number) {
  interaction?.setControlledFocus(interaction.resolvePointer(clientX, clientY))
}

function stopInspecting() {
  interaction?.setControlledFocus(null)
}
```

`resolvePointer` uses the current renderer presentation, including an active
motion or viewport transform, and returns the scene position, primary point,
and complete focus group. `setControlledFocus` paints the same definition-owned
focus and tooltip as chart-owned pointer input. Pass `{ pinned: true }` when the
configured sticky tooltip should accept interaction.

For a drag that does not require a nearby datum, use
`interaction.clientToScene(clientX, clientY)`. It applies the renderer's full
client-to-scene transform without coupling viewport movement to point focus.

`pointer: false` disables automatic pointer move, leave, and click handling. It
does not disable keyboard navigation. Controlled focus has separate ownership,
so unrelated mouse-leave and focus-out events cannot clear it. The stable
controller is available as `host.interaction` and in every `onRender` context.

## Invert resolved scales

First-party behaviors use the final resolved scale. A custom gesture can read
the same optional inverse from the scene:

```ts
const invertX = scene.scales.x.invert
if (!invertX) throw new Error('This interaction requires an invertible x scale')

const date = invertX(pointerX)
```

The resolved y scale already owns its reversed pixel range:

```ts
const invertY = scene.scales.y.invert
if (!invertY) throw new Error('This interaction requires an invertible y scale')

const value = invertY(pointerY)
```

Apply UTC month snapping, numeric rounding, minimum ranges, and domain clamps
after inversion. Those policies are application semantics, not scale math.
This date example uses a D3 time scale; the lightweight linear scale supports
the same resolved mapping and inversion flow for numeric gestures.
Free cursor bindings already consume the resolved inverse. Their `valueAt`
callback is reserved for snapping or another semantic override.

The [Scales](../concepts/scales-and-d3.md) page is the sole source for
D3 ownership and official interaction-module links.

## Disable competing datum focus

When a gesture has no datum inspection at all, disable chart-owned focus explicitly:

```ts
import { focusDisabled } from '@tanstack/charts/focus/disabled'

const gestureDefinition = defineChart(definition, {
  focus: focusDisabled,
  keyboard: false,
})

mountChart(element, {
  definition: gestureDefinition,
  ariaLabel: 'Selectable monthly range',
  onRender: mountBrushOverlay,
})
```

This prevents an application-owned gesture from competing with the host's
point marker and tooltip. First-party host controls such as `brushX` and
`zoomX` isolate their own events.

Use `pointer: false` plus the interaction controller when the application owns
the gesture but the chart should still own datum focus. `focusDisabled` does
not remove keyboard accessibility from application-owned controls.
A definition `cursor` in `free` mode already owns the host pointer path and
does not require `pointer: false` or `focusDisabled`.

## Brush selection

A complete brush owns:

- drag start, move, end, and cancellation;
- reverse dragging normalization;
- semantic snapping;
- a visible selected range;
- focusable handles or equivalent range inputs;
- current-range text;
- reset behavior;
- selection preservation after data updates.

Import the optional first-party behavior and bind it to application state:

```tsx group=controlled-brush env=charts-react file=/src/App.tsx entry
import { useMemo, useState } from 'react'
import { defineChart, lineY } from '@tanstack/charts'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

  const [range, setRange] = useState<BrushRange<number>>(initialRange)
  const definition = useMemo(
    () =>
      defineChart({
        marks: [

        },

        controls: [
          brushX({
            range: controlledSignal<BrushRange<number>, BrushXChange<number>>(
              range,
              (next, { reason }) => {
                if (reason.type === 'commit') setRange(next)
              },
            ),
            values: weeks,
            format: (week) => `Week ${week}`,
            ariaLabel: 'Reporting range',
            startAriaLabel: 'Range start',

        ],
      }),
    [range],
  )

  const isInitial =
    range.start === initialRange.start && range.end === initialRange.end

  return (

      <Chart

  )
}
```

]
```

`values` defines semantic order, snapping, and keyboard steps. It is required
for strings and for keyboard handles. Number and Date brushes may omit it only
with `keyboard: false` and an invertible scale. The range remains non-null: a
blank click proposes a snapped zero-width range, which application policy can
expand into a fixed focus window.

Change reasons distinguish pointer previews, commits, and cancellation from
keyboard commits and cancellation. Rebuild the definition with the accepted
range. The behavior retains active controlled echoes, cancels divergent
external updates, normalizes reverse drags, clamps to the final plot, and
ignores synthetic D3 move events.

SVG and Canvas DOM hosts replace the static scene fallback with one accessible
brush overlay. Static SVG and React Native retain the visual selection only;
native applications must supply their own semantic range control. Import
`d3-brush` and `d3-selection` directly only for a different application-owned
gesture.

## Scale-bound handle

Use `handleX` for one ordered value that the reader can drag or move with a
keyboard, such as a playback position:

```ts
import { defineChart, lineY } from '@tanstack/charts'
import {
  handleX,
  type HandleXChange,
} from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/handle'
import { controlledSignal } from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/signal'

const definition = defineChart({
  marks: [lineY(rows, { x: 'date', y: 'value' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: utcScale },
    y: null,
  },
  controls: [
    handleX({
      value: controlledSignal<Date, HandleXChange<Date>>(currentDate, (next) =>
        setCurrentDate(next),
      ),
      values: observedDates,
      cross: { edge: 'bottom', offset: 8 },
      ariaLabel: 'Playback position',
      format: (date) => dayFormat(date),
    }),
  ],
})
```

`values` is the ordered snapping and keyboard domain. The controlled value
must be one of those candidates. `cross` places the track above or below the
plot, or at a semantic y value with `{ value }`. The default vertical rule
connects the track and plot; set `ruleStyle: false` to omit it.

Pointer and touch movement proposes `preview` changes. Release proposes a
`commit`; cancellation proposes the gesture origin. Arrow keys move one
candidate and Home or End selects an endpoint. Every keyboard move commits
immediately. The SVG and Canvas DOM hosts provide one named horizontal slider
with a 44-pixel hit target by default. Static SVG and React Native paint the
accepted track, rule, and handle but require an application-owned semantic
control for input.

Charts owns final-scale positioning, nearest-candidate snapping, pointer
capture, cancellation, keyboard movement, painting, and host teardown. The
application owns playback clocks, play/pause controls, status text, and
persistence.

## Zoom and pan

Keep zoom state as a semantic window, not an opaque DOM transform. Import the
optional first-party behavior and bind it to the same window used by the x
scale:

```ts
import { defineChart, lineY } from '@tanstack/charts'
import {
  zoomX,
  type ZoomXChange,
  type ZoomXWindow,
} from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/zoom'
import { controlledSignal } from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/signal'

const definition = defineChart({
  marks: [lineY(rows, { x: 'date', y: 'value' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: utcScale.copy().domain([window.start, window.end]) },
    y: null,
  },
  controls: [
    zoomX({
      window: controlledSignal<ZoomXWindow<Date>, ZoomXChange<Date>>(
        window,
        (next) => setWindow(next),
      ),
      extent: fullExtent,
      scaleExtent: [1, 8],
      ariaLabel: 'Zoomable revenue window',
      format: (date) => dayFormat(date),
    }),
  ],
})
```

`extent` is the complete allowed x domain. `scaleExtent` is `[1, maximum]` and
defaults to `[1, Infinity]`. The behavior owns final-scale inversion,
pointer-anchored wheel zoom, drag and horizontal-wheel pan, touch input,
keyboard zoom and pan, clamping, cancellation, and teardown. By default, it
captures the wheel only after its plot surface receives focus. Set
`wheelActivation: 'modifier'` to capture Control+wheel or Command+wheel without
prior focus while leaving every unmodified wheel to the page. Set it to
`always` only when every wheel over the plot should be chart-owned.

Every proposal is a complete number or Date window. `ZoomXChange` distinguishes
gesture `preview`, `commit`, and `cancel` events, includes the gesture origin,
and records its action and source. Rebuild the definition with every accepted
preview for live movement; a cancel proposes the origin. Keyboard changes
commit immediately.

Keep visible-row filtering or clipping, y-domain policy, status, reset and
recovery controls, follow-latest behavior, and persistence in the application.
A reset updates the same controlled window. Import `d3-zoom` directly only
when the application needs a different gesture policy.

## Linked views

Store one semantic cursor, selection, or domain and derive every view from it.
For focus cursors, share a `createChartCursor` controller with `match: 'x'` or
`match: 'y'`. Each view can have an independent opposite-axis scale while
sharing a date or category.

Validate outgoing events by semantic value, not matching pixel positions.
Different chart sizes and margins should still resolve the same selection.

## Timelines and editors

Scrubbers and editable ranges should pair direct manipulation with native
controls:

- range input for a playhead;
- two range inputs or date inputs for an interval;
- Play/Pause and Reset buttons;
- visible duration or current-frame text;
- Escape or Cancel for reversible edits;
- live announcements for committed changes.

The chart renders the controlled state. It does not become the form control.

## Scrollable lanes

For resource timelines, native horizontal overflow is often better than
capturing the wheel:

- keep the lane label rail fixed;
- let the timeline region scroll;
- preserve viewport-relative geometry after updates;
- keep task details reachable by keyboard;
- avoid clipping axis labels at the scroll boundary.

## Lifecycle

An interaction controller may install pointer capture, event listeners,
observers, nested chart hosts, or animation frames. `onRender` can update an
existing controller, but the application surface must destroy every resource
when the chart unmounts or ownership changes. `createChartCursor` itself owns
no platform resources; hosts unsubscribe when destroyed. A host clears only
the exact unpinned state object that it most recently published. If the
application or another host has replaced the controller state, cancellation,
rebinding, or unmount leaves that newer state intact. Pinned state also
survives lifecycle cleanup until an explicit dismissal or programmatic clear.

## Interaction checklist

- State is semantic and controlled.
- Crosshair presentation is derived from focus or a cursor binding instead of
  DOM mutation.
- Geometry comes from `scene.chart` and configured scale copies.
- Chart-owned focus is disabled only when another complete interaction owns the
  surface.
- Pointer, keyboard, and touch reach equivalent outcomes.
- Wheel capture does not unexpectedly trap page scrolling.
- Dragging survives out-of-bounds movement and cancellation.
- Range limits, snapping, and reset are explicit.
- State remains valid after data and size updates.
- External listeners, overlays, and nested hosts are destroyed.
