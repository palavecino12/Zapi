title: Themes and Styling
description: Apply automatic light and dark color behavior, CSS palette tokens, mark styles, and renderer-aware resources.
---

TanStack Charts inherits the surrounding application instead of installing a
global visual theme. The default chart theme uses:

- `currentColor` for foreground, muted text, and grids;
- `transparent` for the chart background;
- six CSS-variable-backed categorical colors.

Set the container's `color` and the chart follows normal light and dark CSS:

```css
.chart-card {
  color: #172033;
  background: #ffffff;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .chart-card {
    color: #e6edf7;
    background: #111827;
  }
}
```

## Palette tokens

Override the default categorical palette at any container boundary:

```css
.revenue-chart {
  --ts-chart-1: #2563eb;
  --ts-chart-2: #f97316;
  --ts-chart-3: #10b981;
  --ts-chart-4: #8b5cf6;
  --ts-chart-5: #ec4899;
  --ts-chart-6: #06b6d4;
}
```

This is the lowest-cost path for application branding. It also preserves
automatic theme changes without rebuilding a chart definition.

## Definition-level theme

Use `theme` when a chart needs explicit scene colors:

```ts
const definition = defineChart({
  marks,
  scales: {
    x: x,
    y: y,
  },

  theme: {
    foreground: '#e5e7eb',
    muted: '#94a3b8',
    grid: '#334155',
    background: '#0f172a',
    palette: ['#38bdf8', '#fb7185', '#4ade80'],
  },
})
```

`theme` is partial. Omitted fields retain defaults. A responsive definition's
`chart` context receives the default build-time theme, which is useful when
marks need the shared palette or foreground tokens. A `theme` returned by that
same builder is merged afterward while the scene is created, so read an
application-supplied theme from the builder's captured values when it must use
those overrides.

Do not encode semantic status by reading the current theme in data
preparation. Keep meaning stable and choose theme-appropriate paint at render
time.

## Mark styling

Built-in marks expose the paint styles relevant to their geometry: fill, stroke,
opacity, widths, line caps, dashes, corner radius, and font properties. A style
can be fixed or data-driven where the mark's option accepts a visual channel.

Keep these responsibilities separate:

- scales map semantic values to visual values;
- mark options select and refine paint;
- the theme supplies shared defaults;
- application CSS controls the surrounding surface.

For categorical or quantitative color mapping, use the canonical
[Legends and Color](./legends-and-color.md) guide.

## Axis title styling

String axis titles use the chart foreground and built-in title typography.
Use the object form when one title needs an explicit text color, opacity, size,
weight, or offset:

```ts
const definition = defineChart({
  marks,
  scales: {
    x: { scale: xScale, axis: { label: 'Month' } },
    y: {
      scale: yScale,
      axis: {
        label: {
          text: 'Revenue (USD)',
          fontSize: 14,
          fontWeight: 700,
          fill: '#2563eb',
          opacity: 0.85,
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

`fill` is the title's text color. The layout measures the configured font size
and weight before resolving automatic guide margins, so larger titles do not
need matching manual margins.

## Canvas styling

The Canvas renderer resolves scene paints such as `currentColor` and CSS
custom properties against the chart's computed environment. It inherits the
root font and repaints after relevant ancestor class, style, `data-theme`,
color-scheme, forced-colors, or viewport changes.

Rasterized scene nodes are not DOM descendants. A node's `className` therefore
cannot be targeted by a CSS selector after paint. Put data-dependent fill,
stroke, opacity, and font choices in mark options or the chart theme; use
container CSS for palette variables, inherited color, and typography.

## Gradients and clipping

Gradients are opt-in resources. Declare them on the chart:

```ts group=gradient-area env=charts file=/src/chart.ts entry
import { areaY, defineChart, lineY } from '@tanstack/charts'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { scalePoint } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/point'
import { rows } from './data'

export default defineChart({
  marks: [
    areaY(rows, {
      x: 'month',
      y: 'revenue',
      fill: 'url(#revenue-fill)',
    }),
    lineY(rows, {
      x: 'month',
      y: 'revenue',
      stroke: '#2563eb',
      strokeWidth: 2,
    }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: () => scalePoint<string>().padding(0.2) },
    y: {
      scale: scaleLinear,
      grid: true,
      axis: { label: 'Revenue (USD)' },
    },
  },

  gradients: [
    {
      id: 'revenue-fill',
      x1: 0,
      y1: 1,
      x2: 0,
      y2: 0,
      stops: [
        { offset: 0, color: '#2563eb', opacity: 0.08 },
        { offset: 1, color: '#2563eb', opacity: 0.7 },
      ],
    },
  ],
  clip: true,
})
```

```ts group=gradient-area file=/src/data.ts collapsed
export const rows = [
  { month: 'Jan', revenue: 36_000 },
  { month: 'Feb', revenue: 48_000 },
  { month: 'Mar', revenue: 45_000 },
  { month: 'Apr', revenue: 62_000 },
  { month: 'May', revenue: 76_000 },
  { month: 'Jun', revenue: 71_000 },
]
```

Use `url(#revenue-fill)` as the mark paint. Default SVG hosts emit and scope the
resource; `idPrefix` keeps resource and clip IDs distinct when several charts
share a document.

Set `clip: true` when marks should be clipped to the resolved plot rectangle.
Clipping is a geometry policy, not a substitute for correct scale domains.

SVG and React Native consume both linear and radial gradients for fills and
strokes. Canvas consumes linear fills and strokes plus radial fills. It maps a
radial fill through each shape's normalized bounds, so a non-square shape has
the same `objectBoundingBox` ellipse as SVG, then clips the paint to the shape.
A Canvas gradient needs measurable node bounds; path-only geometry with no
point bounds should use an explicit paint instead. Canvas rejects radial
strokes because the required nonuniform transform would distort stroke width.

## HTML tooltip styling

The built-in DOM tooltip is an HTML element inside the chart container by default.
Give it a class through `tooltip.className` and style that class in application
CSS:

```ts
import { tooltip } from '@tanstack/charts/tooltip'

const definition = defineChart(baseDefinition, {
  tooltip: { use: tooltip, className: 'revenue-tooltip' },
})
```

The default tooltip chrome also reads CSS variables from the chart container.
This avoids selector specificity fights with its positioning styles:

```css
.revenue-chart {
  --ts-chart-tooltip-background: color-mix(in srgb, Canvas 92%, transparent);
  --ts-chart-tooltip-color: CanvasText;
  --ts-chart-tooltip-border: 1px solid
    color-mix(in srgb, CanvasText 12%, transparent);
  --ts-chart-tooltip-border-radius: 0.625rem;
  --ts-chart-tooltip-shadow: 0 12px 34px
    color-mix(in srgb, CanvasText 14%, transparent);
}
```

`--ts-chart-tooltip-max-width`, `--ts-chart-tooltip-padding`, and
`--ts-chart-tooltip-font` control the remaining surface defaults. A
`className` is still useful for content-specific layout.

With the `portal` extension, the preferred manual-Popover path keeps the
element under the chart in the DOM, so inheritance and scoped selectors
continue to work. If Popover is unavailable or fails, the fixed fallback moves
the element under the chart's `ownerDocument` body. Use a document-level
selector for its class and put required fallback tokens on that class or a
shared document ancestor.

Every framework adapter can compose native application content with the
default rows. See [Tooltips and Focus](./tooltips-and-focus.md).

See [Themes and Motion examples](../examples/themes-and-motion.md) for complete
cards with inherited palettes, gradients, controls, and optional motion.

## Theme checklist

- Default charts inherit text color and respond to the application's color
  scheme.
- Palette CSS variables are scoped to the smallest useful container.
- Semantic status remains distinguishable without color alone.
- Explicit chart themes meet contrast requirements in every supported mode.
- Resource IDs use a stable `idPrefix` when charts share a document.
- A theme change does not recreate application data or lose focused state.
