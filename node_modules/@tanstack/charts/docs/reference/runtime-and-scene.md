title: Runtime and Scene
description: Compile object and responsive chart definitions into renderer-neutral scenes.
---

TanStack Charts separates semantic chart construction from rendering:

1. a definition produces a [chart spec](./chart-spec.md)
2. marks materialize channels
3. scales and guide layout resolve against the current size
4. marks emit a keyed `ChartScene`
5. the selected SVG, Canvas, or custom renderer consumes that scene

Use `createChartRuntime` for repeated renders of object or responsive
definitions.
Use `createChartScene` for one static compilation.

## `createChartRuntime`

```ts
import { createChartRuntime } from '@tanstack/charts/runtime'

const runtime = createChartRuntime<Row, Date, number>({
  defaultTheme: platformTheme,
})
const scene = runtime.render(definition, {
  width: 800,
  height: 400,
})

runtime.destroy()
```

```ts
function createChartRuntime<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
>(options?: ChartRuntimeOptions): ChartRuntime<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
```

`ChartRuntime.render` accepts a definition, size, and optional layout:

```ts
interface RuntimeRenderSignature {
  render(
    definition,
    size: { width: number; height: number },
    layout?: {
      measureText?: ChartTextMeasurer
      typography?: ChartTextTypography
    },
  ): ChartScene
}
```

Because a standalone runtime is created before its first `render` call, direct
use can supply datum, x-value, and y-value generics at the factory. DOM and
framework adapter hosts infer them from the definition.

### Runtime behavior

The runtime does not cache application data. A responsive builder receives the
current surface size and the runtime's platform `defaultTheme` on every direct
render. The same default theme is applied before the authored definition theme
during final scene compilation. Framework adapters and application code own
definition memoization and asynchronous cleanup.

## `createChartScene`

```ts
import { createChartScene } from '@tanstack/charts/scene'

const scene = createChartScene(
  staticDefinition,
  { width: 800, height: 400 },
  { measureText, typography },
)
```

```ts
function createChartScene<
  TDatum,
  TXValue extends ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue,
>(
  definition: StaticChartDefinition<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
  size: ChartSize,
  layout?: ChartLayoutOptions,
): ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
```

`createChartScene` accepts static definitions only. It normalizes each scene
dimension to at least `1`, using `1` for a nonfinite value, resolves the theme,
initializes every mark, collects x, y, and color channels, resolves configured
scales, measures guides and legends, renders each mark once into the final
chart bounds, and returns a scene value.

It throws when a materialized positional channel has no scale. Omit dimensions
that no mark uses; explicit `null` is accepted only for an unused dimension.

## `defaultChartTheme`

```ts
import { defaultChartTheme } from '@tanstack/charts/scene'
```

The exported theme contains:

- `foreground: 'currentColor'`
- `muted: 'currentColor'`
- `grid: 'currentColor'`
- `background: 'transparent'`
- six CSS-variable-backed palette entries

Definitions merge partial overrides into this value. A supplied palette
replaces the default palette. An omitted focus ring defaults to enabled. See
[Chart spec](./chart-spec.md#theme).

## `findNearestPoint`

```ts
import { findNearestPoint } from '@tanstack/charts/scene'

const point = findNearestPoint(scene, x, y, 48)
```

```ts
function findNearestPoint<
  TDatum,
  TXValue extends ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue,
>(
  scene: ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
  x: number,
  y: number,
  maxDistance?: number,
  points?: readonly ChartPoint<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>[],
): ChartPoint<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue> | null
```

Coordinates are in scene pixels. `maxDistance` defaults to `Infinity`.
`points` defaults to `scene.points`. Supplying a candidate list restricts both
primitive-attached and anchor-only resolution to those exact point objects.
The function caches a paint-ordered interaction target list for the scene,
checks primitive containment first, and then applies each target's natural
axis or geometric affinity. Scene traversal accumulates group translation and
clipping, so the resolver and renderer consume the same post-layout tree.
Semantic points not attached to primitives retain legacy anchor distance. For
a large point set, supply a spatial index to the DOM or framework host; see
[Focus and interaction](./focus-and-interaction.md#spatial-indexes).

## `viewportInteractionPoints`

```ts
import {
  findNearestPoint,
  viewportInteractionPoints,
} from '@tanstack/charts/scene'

const candidates = viewportInteractionPoints(scene, presentationPoints)
const point = findNearestPoint(scene, x, y, 48, candidates)
```

```ts
function viewportInteractionPoints<
  TDatum,
  TXValue extends ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue,
>(
  scene: ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
  points?: readonly ChartPoint<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>[],
): readonly ChartPoint<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>[]
```

`points` defaults to `scene.points`. With no active axis viewport, the helper
returns that list unchanged. Otherwise it removes off-window points only from
marks painted inside a viewport clip. Points from marks with fixed viewport
ownership remain available outside `scene.chart`. Pass a renderer's current
presentation points during motion so visibility and nearest-point resolution
use the same painted coordinates.

## `ChartScene`

```ts
interface ChartScene<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> {
  width: number
  height: number
  margin: ChartMargin
  chart: ChartBounds
  nodes: readonly SceneNode[]
  points: readonly ChartPoint<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>[]
  scales: Readonly<Record<string, ResolvedScale>>
  colors: ResolvedColorScale
  gradients: readonly ChartGradient[]
  theme: ChartTheme
  focusGuides?: readonly SceneFocusGuide[]
}
```

| Property          | Meaning                                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `width`, `height` | Full scene dimensions                                            |
| `margin`          | Resolved outer margins after guide and legend measurement        |
| `chart`           | Inner plot bounds with `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`           |
| `nodes`           | Ordered renderer-neutral display tree                            |
| `points`          | Complete interaction set, including viewport-clipped points      |
| `scales`          | Resolved positional scales, normally under `x` and `y`           |
| `colors`          | Resolved chart color scale                                       |
| `gradients`       | Declared linear and radial gradient resources                    |
| `theme`           | Fully resolved theme                                             |
| `focusGuides`     | Optional data-less guide descriptors resolved from current focus |

`focusGuides` do not add nodes or points to the base scene. Every guide carries
a required resolver that receives its local focus, pointer, and cursor context
and returns one transient scene node or `undefined`. Surfaces pass the current
interaction state to `resolveFocusPresentation`, which calls those resolvers
and separates their nodes into underlays and overlays. A mark emits
`MarkFocusGuide`, whose optional placement defaults from mark order. The scene
compiler produces the final `SceneFocusGuide` values shown here with placement
resolved; renderers do not call guide resolvers or infer placement themselves.

## Scene nodes

Every scene node has a stable `key`, optional `className`, optional
`SceneStyle`, and optional `ariaHidden`. Geometric primitives may also attach
a `SceneInteraction`; groups and labels cannot.

| `kind`     | Geometry                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `group`    | `children`, optional translation and clip bounds                    |
| `rule`     | `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`                                              |
| `polyline` | point pairs and optional precomputed path data                      |
| `area`     | closed points, structured polygons and holes, or optional path data |
| `dot`      | center and radius                                                   |
| `rect`     | origin, dimensions, and optional uniform or per-corner radii        |
| `label`    | origin, text, anchor, baseline, rotation, size, and weight          |

`SceneStyle` supports fill, fill opacity, stroke, stroke opacity, stroke width,
overall opacity, line cap, line join, and dash array.

`SceneArea.polygons` is authoritative when present. Each polygon contains an
exterior ring followed by zero or more hole rings; one area can contain several
disconnected polygons. SVG and React Native serialize the rings with even-odd
fill, while Canvas paints them directly without `Path2D`. Bounds and exact
geometry containment use every ring.

`SceneRect.inset` retains the resolved inset for absolute inline-state
overrides. Its optional `insetAxis` is `x`, `y`, or `xy`; vertical and
horizontal bars use only their categorical axis, while ordinary rectangles use
both axes. `SceneRect.maxThickness` retains a bar's categorical size ceiling so
an inline-state inset cannot widen its resolved geometry past that ceiling.
Renderers consume the already-resolved rectangle geometry. `SceneRect.radius`
is the compatible uniform radius. `SceneRect.cornerRadii` stores physical
top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left radii. SVG and React Native
render selective corners as a path, while Canvas paints the same normalized
geometry directly. Custom renderers can import `resolveRectCornerRadii` and
`rectCornerRadiiPath` from `@tanstack/charts/renderer/rect` instead of
duplicating that geometry policy.

```ts
type SceneInteraction =
  | {
      point: ChartPoint
      points?: never
      affinity?: 'x' | 'y' | 'xy' | 'geometry'
    }
  | {
      point?: never
      points: readonly ChartPoint[]
      affinity?: 'x' | 'y' | 'xy' | 'geometry'
    }
```

Attach the exact point object returned in `MarkScene.points`. A continuous
primitive can attach several points, allowing one rendered line or area to
choose its nearest semantic sample without duplicating the primitive geometry.

Custom marks should return the smallest honest scene tree and stable keys. The
full initialization and render contracts are in
[Custom extensions](./custom-extensions.md#custom-marks).

## Interaction points

```ts
interface ChartPoint<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> {
  key: string
  markId: string
  group: string | number | null
  groupLabel: string
  datum: TDatum
  datumIndex: number
  xValue: TXValue
  yValue: TYValue
  x1Value?: ChartValue
  x2Value?: ChartValue
  y1Value?: ChartValue
  y2Value?: ChartValue
  xInterval?: 'range' | 'difference'
  yInterval?: 'range' | 'difference'
  x: number
  y: number
  color: string
}
```

`xValue` and `yValue` are semantic values inferred from mark channels. `x` and
`y` are scene-pixel interaction coordinates. Interval marks also retain their
endpoints and whether the presented value is a range or endpoint difference.
The interaction coordinate need not describe every piece of a mark's geometry:
an interval rect may focus at its center, a link at its midpoint, and an arrow
at its endpoint.
