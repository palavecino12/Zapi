title: Rendering and Export
description: Render chart scenes through the default SVG renderer, the optional Canvas renderer, or a custom surface, then export supported output.
---

TanStack Charts compiles a renderer-neutral scene. The default renderer turns
that scene into accessible SVG markup; an optional Canvas renderer paints the
same scene through Canvas 2D. Both use the shared responsive, interaction,
tooltip, keyboard, and runtime host.

Use the task-oriented [Exporting guide](../guides/exporting.md) to choose
between static scene rendering, mounted SVG serialization, and raster output.

## Choose a renderer

Renderer code stays behind explicit entry points:

| Use                              | Import                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Default vanilla SVG host         | `mountChart` from `@tanstack/charts/dom`              |
| Vanilla Canvas host              | `mountCanvasChart` from `@tanstack/charts/canvas`     |
| Tween and spring SVG renderer    | `motion` from `@tanstack/charts/motion`               |
| Renderer-neutral host            | `mountChartRenderer` from `@tanstack/charts/renderer` |
| Default React SVG component      | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/react`                 |
| Default Preact SVG component     | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/preact`                |
| Default Vue SVG component        | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/vue`                   |
| Default Solid SVG component      | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/solid`                 |
| Default Svelte SVG component     | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/svelte`                |
| Default Angular SVG component    | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/angular`               |
| Default Lit SVG element          | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/lit`                   |
| Default Alpine SVG directive     | `charts` from `@tanstack/charts/alpine`               |
| React Native SVG component       | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/react-native`          |
| React Canvas component           | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/react/canvas`          |
| React custom-renderer component  | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/react/core`            |
| Default Octane SVG component     | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/octane`                |
| Octane Canvas component          | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/octane/canvas`         |
| Octane custom-renderer component | `Chart` from `@tanstack/charts/octane/core`           |

The default package and adapter entries do not import Canvas. Applications pay
for it only when they import a Canvas entry. Motion is likewise isolated behind
`@tanstack/charts/motion`. The `/core` adapter entries accept an explicit
`renderer` without choosing one for the application.

A default SVG host can still compose selected Canvas marks. Import
`canvasChartRenderer` from `@tanstack/charts/canvas` and attach it to those
marks. The default adapter remains the host, and the Canvas painter enters the
module graph through that explicit import.

## React Native adapter

The React Native entry selects its native build through the package export
conditions and renders the shared scene with `react-native-svg`.

```ts
import {
  Chart,
  resolveNativePaint,
  type NativeChartRenderContext,
  type NativeChartTooltipRenderContext,
  type NativePaintContext,
  type NativePaintResolver,
} from '@tanstack/charts/react-native'
import {
  tooltip,
  type NativeChartTooltipComponent,
  type NativeChartTooltipExtension,
  type NativeChartTooltipProps,
} from '@tanstack/charts/react-native/tooltip'
```

`NativeChartRenderContext` is passed to `Chart`'s `onRender` callback.
`NativeChartTooltipRenderContext` is passed to a custom tooltip renderer.
`NativeChartTooltipProps` describes the built-in native tooltip component,
whose component and extension contracts are `NativeChartTooltipComponent` and
`NativeChartTooltipExtension`.

Use `resolveNativePaint` as the default `NativePaintResolver`. It resolves
`currentColor`, Canvas system colors, and CSS-variable fallbacks against a
`NativePaintContext`. Pass a custom resolver through `Chart` when the
application owns additional paint tokens.

## `renderChartSvg`

```ts
import { renderChartSvg } from '@tanstack/charts/svg'

const markup = renderChartSvg(scene, {
  ariaLabel: 'Weekly revenue',
  ariaDescription: 'Revenue increased through the second quarter.',
  idPrefix: 'revenue',
})
```

```ts
function renderChartSvg(
  scene: ChartScene,
  options: RenderChartSvgOptions,
): string

interface RenderChartSvgOptions {
  ariaLabel: string
  ariaDescription?: string
  className?: string
  tabIndex?: number
  idPrefix?: string
}
```

| Option            | Default  | Meaning                                               |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `ariaLabel`       | Required | Accessible SVG name                                   |
| `ariaDescription` | None     | Escaped SVG `<desc>` content                          |
| `className`       | None     | Added after the `ts-chart` class                      |
| `tabIndex`        | `0`      | SVG tab index for direct static rendering             |
| `idPrefix`        | Empty    | Prefix passed to renderers that generate document IDs |

The SVG uses `role="img"`, `aria-roledescription="chart"`, a responsive
`width="100%"` and `height="100%"`, the scene's dimensions as its `viewBox`,
and an overflow-visible display style. A nontransparent scene background
renders as the first rect. All labels escape text and inherit the document
font.

Focus-filtered scene groups render hidden until the DOM host supplies focus
state. Data-less crosshair guides are also transient and are absent from this
static serialization because no focus or cursor state was supplied. Scene keys
become `data-ts-key` attributes for reconciliation.

## Canvas renderer

```ts
import { mountCanvasChart } from '@tanstack/charts/canvas'
import { tooltip } from '@tanstack/charts/tooltip'

const interactiveDefinition = defineChart(definition, { tooltip })

const host = mountCanvasChart(container, {
  definition: interactiveDefinition,
  ariaLabel: 'Weekly revenue',
})
```

`mountCanvasChart` has the same definition, sizing, focus, spatial-index,
keyboard, tooltip, selection, update, and destroy behavior as `mountChart`.
The renderer paints authored focus layers and crosshair guides below or above
the base scene on separate canvases, uses the browser device-pixel ratio by
default, and maps pointer coordinates back into the scene.

```ts
interface CanvasChartRendererOptions {
  pixelRatio?: number
}

interface CanvasChartSurface<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> extends ChartSurface<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue> {
  readonly element: HTMLDivElement
  readonly canvas: HTMLCanvasElement
  readonly backgroundCanvas: HTMLCanvasElement
  readonly focusUnderCanvas: HTMLCanvasElement
  readonly sceneCanvas: HTMLCanvasElement
  readonly focusCanvas: HTMLCanvasElement
}

interface CanvasChartRenderer<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> extends ChartLayerRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue> {
  mount: (
    container: HTMLElement,
    requestRender: (force?: boolean) => void,
  ) => CanvasChartSurface<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
}

type CanvasChartHostOptions<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> = Omit<ChartRendererHostOptions<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>, 'renderer'>

interface CanvasChartHost<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> {
  update: (options: CanvasChartHostOptions<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>) => void
  getScene: () => ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
  destroy: () => void
}

function createCanvasChartRenderer<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
>(
  options?: CanvasChartRendererOptions,
): CanvasChartRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>

const canvasChartRenderer: CanvasChartRenderer

function mountCanvasChart<
  TDatum,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
>(
  container: HTMLElement,
  initialOptions: CanvasChartHostOptions<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
  runtime?: ChartRuntime<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
): CanvasChartHost<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
```

The surface's `element` is its accessible chart root. `canvas` is the stable
base bitmap: chart background plus ordinary scene, without transient focus.
It remains suitable for direct `toBlob()` and `toDataURL()` calls and is not
part of the live visual stack. The live stack is `backgroundCanvas`,
`focusUnderCanvas`, `sceneCanvas`, then `focusCanvas`. This lets an underlay
paint above an opaque chart background but below ordinary marks without
repainting the stable base bitmap on cursor movement.

A finite, positive `pixelRatio` fixes every backing store at that ratio. An
omitted value uses `devicePixelRatio`, then `1`; an invalid value uses `1`.

`CanvasChartHostOptions` removes the required `renderer` from the
renderer-neutral host options. The returned `CanvasChartHost` owns update,
scene access, and cleanup. Its optional runtime parameter has the same advanced
prerender-reuse contract as [`mountChart`](./dom-host.md#signature), including
runtime ownership on destroy.

Use `canvasChartRenderer` for the shared default instance. Call
`createCanvasChartRenderer` when the application needs a fixed `pixelRatio` or
an independently typed renderer instance.

The server-facing `prerender` step emits a deterministic, named chart shell
with five `aria-hidden` canvases: the hidden stable `canvas` base bitmap plus
the public `backgroundCanvas`, `focusUnderCanvas`, `sceneCanvas`, and
`focusCanvas` live layers. It does not attempt server-side pixel painting. The
browser adopts that shell, sizes the backing stores, paints the scene, and
attaches the shared interaction host. See
[SSR and Hydration](../guides/ssr-and-hydration.md).

Canvas is an escape hatch for paint-heavy SVG output, not an unbounded-data
mode. Scene compilation, channel arrays, scene nodes, and interaction points
still exist. A default nearest-point lookup remains linear unless the chart
supplies a `spatialIndex`; measure the complete pipeline and bound or aggregate
output when pixels cannot distinguish the observations.

Renderer-specific tradeoffs:

- Canvas updates raster pixels instead of retaining one DOM element per scene
  node.
- Canvas animation crossfades complete frames; SVG animation reconciles and
  interpolates keyed elements.
- Curved, polar, and geographic `path` geometry requires browser `Path2D`.
- Structured `SceneArea.polygons` render directly and do not require `Path2D`.
- Scene-node `className` values do not create styleable Canvas descendants.
- Gradients require geometry with measurable bounds.
- Radial gradients support Canvas fills only. A radial stroke throws rather
  than changing stroke width under a nonuniform bounds transform.

Linear gradients map their normalized endpoints directly into each node's
bounds. Radial fills are clipped to the node, then painted in normalized unit
space under the node's bounds transform. This preserves SVG
`objectBoundingBox` behavior, including an elliptical gradient on a non-square
node.

## SVG resources

```ts
import { renderChartSvg } from '@tanstack/charts/svg'
import { renderChartSvgWithResources } from '@tanstack/charts/svg/resources'
```

`renderChartSvg` and the compatible explicit
`renderChartSvgWithResources(scene, options)` entry both:

- emit declared linear and radial gradients in `<defs>`
- scope gradient IDs with sanitized `idPrefix`
- rewrite matching `url(#gradient-id)` paints
- emit clip paths for scene groups with `clip` bounds

Default SVG hosts and framework adapters use this behavior without a custom
`renderSvg`. Use a stable, document-unique `idPrefix`. Gradient coordinates and
stop offsets are clamped to `0..1` and emitted as percentages. A radial
gradient defaults to center `(0.5, 0.5)` and radius `0.5`; each omitted focal
coordinate inherits the matching center coordinate.

The React Native adapter emits matching `LinearGradient` and `RadialGradient`
resources through `react-native-svg`. Its `Chart` generates an `idPrefix` with
`useId()` unless the application supplies one, then scopes resource IDs and
rewrites matching paints in the same way as the web adapters.

## `reconcileChartSvg`

```ts
import { reconcileChartSvg } from '@tanstack/charts/reconcile'

const cancel = reconcileChartSvg(container, nextMarkup, {
  duration: 240,
  easing: 'ease-out',
})

cancel()
```

```ts
function reconcileChartSvg(
  container: HTMLElement,
  markup: string,
  animation?: ChartAnimationOptions,
): () => void
```

The reconciler adopts a compatible existing root, matches children by
`data-ts-key`, moves retained nodes into their new order, inserts entries, and
removes exits. When a node has no explicit key, same-tag sibling order is a
fallback identity.

Without animation, changed attributes and structure commit synchronously.
With animation:

- numeric attributes with compatible string structure interpolate
- entries fade from zero opacity
- exits fade to zero and are then removed
- noninterpolable values commit immediately
- a returned cancellation function stops the current frame loop

The DOM host calls reconciliation and cancellation for you.

Custom SVG renderers that already own a keyed subtree can reconcile only that
subtree without reparsing or walking the surrounding chart:

```ts
import { reconcileChartSvgFragment } from '@tanstack/charts/reconcile'

const cancel = reconcileChartSvgFragment(currentGroup, nextGroupMarkup, {
  duration: 180,
})
```

```ts
function reconcileChartSvgFragment(
  currentRoot: SVGElement,
  markup: string,
  animation?: ChartAnimationOptions,
): () => void
```

The fragment root must keep the same namespace and element name to preserve
its identity. Otherwise the reconciler replaces it. Child keying, tweening,
and cancellation match `reconcileChartSvg`.

## Animation options

```ts
interface ChartAnimationOptions {
  duration?: number
  easing?:
    | 'linear'
    | 'ease'
    | 'ease-in'
    | 'ease-out'
    | 'ease-in-out'
    | ((progress: number) => number)
  respectReducedMotion?: boolean
  resize?: boolean
}
```

| Option                 | Default      | Meaning                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `duration`             | `240`        | Animation length in milliseconds, clamped to zero      |
| `easing`               | `'ease-out'` | Named built-in easing or a progress-mapping function   |
| `respectReducedMotion` | `true`       | Lets a host suppress animation for reduced-motion mode |
| `resize`               | `false`      | Animates responsive and explicit host size changes     |

On a definition, `svgAnimation: true` uses `240` milliseconds, `ease-out`, and respects
`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. A numeric duration is clamped to at least
zero. A custom easing receives raw progress from `0` to `1`.

`respectReducedMotion` and `resize` are definition policies enforced by the
host. Direct
`reconcileChartSvg(container, markup, animation)` calls run the supplied
animation without consulting media queries or render reasons.

Host animation begins only after the initial render. Updates without a scene
render do not start an animation; the current animation options apply to the
next reconciliation. Responsive and explicit size changes commit immediately
unless `resize: true`.

Stable mark IDs and resolved datum identities are essential for meaningful
transitions.

## SVG serialization

```ts
import { downloadChartSvg, serializeChartSvg } from '@tanstack/charts/export'

const source = serializeChartSvg(container, {
  width: 1200,
  height: 600,
  includeFocus: false,
})

downloadChartSvg(container, 'revenue.svg')
```

The subpath exports `serializeChartSvg`, `downloadChartSvg`, and the
`SerializeChartSvgOptions` type.

```ts
interface SerializeChartSvgOptions {
  width?: number
  height?: number
  includeFocus?: boolean
}
```

`target` may be the SVG or an ancestor containing `svg.ts-chart`. The serializer
clones the SVG, adds the XML namespace, removes focus-filtered scene layers
unless `includeFocus` is true, and resolves dimensions from options, then the
`viewBox`, then client dimensions.

The serializer can inline computed `color`, fill, fill opacity, font family,
font size, font weight, opacity, stroke, stroke opacity, stroke width, and
stroke dash array when they depend on inherited font, `currentColor`, or CSS
custom properties. Linear and radial resources remain in the cloned `<defs>`,
and their stop color and opacity receive the same treatment. Keep other
CSS-dependent resource styling explicit until it is part of that serialization
contract.

`downloadChartSvg(target, filename?, options?)` defaults to `chart.svg` and
downloads an SVG blob through the target's document.

## Browser image export

```ts
import { downloadChartImage, renderChartImage } from '@tanstack/charts/export'

const blob = await renderChartImage(container, {
  type: 'image/webp',
  scale: 2,
  background: '#fff',
  quality: 0.9,
})

await downloadChartImage(container, 'revenue.png', {
  scale: 2,
})
```

The browser image functions are `renderChartImage` and
`downloadChartImage`.

```ts
interface RenderChartImageOptions extends SerializeChartSvgOptions {
  scale?: number
  background?: string
  type?: 'image/png' | 'image/jpeg' | 'image/webp'
  quality?: number
}
```

Despite its historical name, `RenderChartImageOptions` supports PNG, JPEG, and
WebP. `scale` defaults to `2` and is clamped to at least `0.1`. `type` defaults
to `image/png`.

Raster export requires:

- a browser document and window
- nonzero chart dimensions
- Canvas 2D
- successful browser decoding when the source is SVG

The promise rejects when any requirement fails or Canvas encoding returns no
blob. `downloadChartImage` defaults to `chart.png`; keep the filename extension
consistent with the selected MIME type.

The raster helpers accept a mounted SVG, Canvas, or mixed chart root, or an
ancestor containing one. SVG is serialized, decoded, and drawn into the export
canvas. Canvas uses the stable `canvas` base bitmap directly when focus is
excluded. With `includeFocus`, it composites `backgroundCanvas`,
`focusUnderCanvas`, `sceneCanvas`, and `focusCanvas` in that order. Mixed roots
draw every child surface in visual order. `serializeChartSvg` and
`downloadChartSvg` reject mixed roots and remain SVG-only.

## Mark-level renderers

Built-in Cartesian, radial, and composite marks accept a `renderer` option.
Passing `canvasChartRenderer` opts that mark into Canvas while axes, guides,
and marks without the option keep the host renderer:

```ts
import { areaY, defineChart, lineY, text } from '@tanstack/charts'
import { canvasChartRenderer } from '@tanstack/charts/canvas'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { scaleUtc } from 'd3-scale'

const definition = defineChart({
  marks: [
    areaY(denseRows, {
      x: 'time',
      y: 'value',
      renderer: canvasChartRenderer,
    }),
    lineY(summaryRows, { x: 'time', y: 'value' }),
    text(labels, { x: 'time', y: 'value', text: 'label' }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scaleUtc },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear },
  },
})
```

Adjacent nodes with the same renderer share a layer. Alternating renderer runs
remain in declaration order, including nested runs inside facets, composites,
and `polar`. Server output contains one accessible mixed root with
deterministic child shells, and the browser adopts those shells. Direct
`renderChartSvg(scene, options)` calls remain an explicit SVG serialization of
the complete renderer-neutral scene and do not run surface composition.

The universal mark contract stays small:

```ts
interface ChartMarkRenderer {
  readonly kind: 'chart-layer-renderer'
  readonly id: string
}

interface ChartMarkOptions {
  renderer?: ChartMarkRenderer
}
```

A renderer that mounts one DOM layer implements the complete composition
contract:

```ts
interface ChartLayerRenderer<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
>
  extends ChartRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>, ChartMarkRenderer {
  compose: (
    defaultRenderer: ChartRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
  ) => ChartRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
}

interface UniversalChartLayerRenderer
  extends UniversalChartRenderer, ChartMarkRenderer {
  compose: (
    defaultRenderer: ChartRenderer<any, any, any>,
  ) => ChartRenderer<any, any, any>
}
```

The first non-default mark renderer supplies the compositor. The built-in
Canvas renderer can compose normal `ChartRenderer` surfaces and exposes the
result as one `ChartSurface`.

Mark motion and renderer selection are independent in the authoring API. The
built-in factories preserve both options, and `createMark` keeps motion as its
second argument and accepts the renderer as its third. The optional
`motion()` renderer consumes tween and spring policy only on layers it owns.
`canvasChartRenderer` paints the final mark scene and does not interpret that
policy. A host `svgAnimation` can still crossfade complete Canvas frames while
SVG layers reconcile keyed elements. Changing the layer renderer sequence
remounts the composition, so that structural update does not animate between
the old and new surface layout.

## Custom renderers

The renderer-neutral boundary consists of a renderer instance contract and
the mounted surface it returns:

```ts
interface ChartSurfaceRenderOptions extends RenderChartOptions {
  animation?: ChartAnimationOptions
}

interface ChartSurface<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> {
  readonly renderer: ChartRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
  readonly element: Element
  readonly layers?: readonly ChartSurface<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>[]
  readonly defaultElement?: Element
  render: (
    scene: ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
    options: ChartSurfaceRenderOptions,
  ) => void
  clientToScene?: (
    scene: ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
    clientX: number,
    clientY: number,
  ) => { x: number; y: number } | null
  getPresentationPoints?: () =>
    readonly ChartPoint<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>[] | undefined
  subscribePresentationPoints?: (
    listener: (points: readonly ChartPoint<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>[]) => void,
  ) => () => void
  paintFocus: (
    focus: ChartFocusState<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue> | null,
    pointer?: ChartTooltipPosition | null,
    cursor?: ChartCursorPresentation<TXValue, TYValue> | null,
  ) => ChartScene | void
  destroy: () => void
}

interface ChartRenderer<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> {
  readonly id: string
  readonly capabilities?: ChartRendererCapabilities
  prerender: (
    scene: ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
    options: RenderChartOptions,
  ) => string
  mount: (
    container: HTMLElement,
    requestRender: (force?: boolean) => void,
  ) => ChartSurface<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
}

interface ChartRendererRenderContext<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> {
  container: HTMLElement
  scene: ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
  surface: ChartSurface<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
  interaction: ChartInteractionController<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
}
```

`element` is the one accessible, interactive root. `layers`, when present,
lists child surfaces from back to front. `defaultElement` is the topmost
surface element owned by the host's default renderer. SVG-oriented
`ChartRenderContext` callbacks expose that element as `svg` and also include
the complete renderer-neutral `surface`. `ChartRendererRenderContext` exposes
the complete surface directly.

```ts
interface ChartRenderContext<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
> {
  container: HTMLElement
  svg: SVGSVGElement
  scene: ChartScene<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
  surface: ChartSurface<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
  interaction: ChartInteractionController<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>
}
```

### Rectangle geometry helpers

Custom rectangle renderers can share the built-in corner-fit policy:

```ts
import {
  rectCornerRadiiPath,
  resolveRectCornerRadii,
} from '@tanstack/charts/renderer/rect'
```

`resolveRectCornerRadii(corners, width, height)` changes invalid or negative
values to zero and proportionally fits adjacent radii within the rectangle.
`rectCornerRadiiPath(x, y, width, height, corners)` serializes the same
normalized geometry as a stable SVG path. The helper accepts reversed width or
height and keeps the tuple in physical corner order.

`requestRender()` asks the shared host to rebuild and repaint on its next
animation frame; ordinary requests proceed only when a container-owned width
or height changed.
`requestRender(true)` forces the work when renderer state changed without a
width or chart-option change, such as device-pixel ratio or resolved theme
colors. Requests made before the same frame are coalesced.

Renderer capabilities are structural so independently bundled package
entrypoints do not need shared object or symbol identity. A renderer can expose
`capabilities.tooltipMotion` with protocol `1`; the host creates its controller
and injects it as `ChartTooltipExtensionContext.motion`. Renderers that omit the
capability do not load or run tooltip motion code.

Animated renderers can expose their current point geometry through
`getPresentationPoints()` and notify the host through
`subscribePresentationPoints()`. The host then resolves stationary pointers,
pinned tooltips, and keyboard focus against the painted positions rather than
the destination scene.

When focus activates inline mark-state geometry, return the resolved scene that
the surface paints. The host uses that destination scene for subsequent
pointer resolution while the renderer animates toward it. Returning `void`
keeps the base scene as the interaction source and remains valid for renderers
that do not resolve alternate scene geometry.

Custom surfaces can reuse the environment-safe focus lifecycle exported from
the root and `/universal` entries:

```ts
const focusedScene = resolveFocusScene(scene, focus).scene
const under = focusedSceneNodes(focusedScene, focus, 'under')
const over = focusedSceneNodes(focusedScene, focus, 'over')
```

`resolveFocusScene` materializes retargetable focus candidates under stable
keys. `focusedSceneNodes` returns the ordinary nodes for the requested paint
placement. `resolveFocusPresentation(scene, focus, pointer, cursor)` applies
that lifecycle and returns renderer-neutral `under` and `over` nodes. Paint
them in this order: `under`, the base scene, then `over`. The optional cursor
argument is the controller state projected into this surface's plot and can
drive a crosshair without datum focus. This is the same path used by the SVG,
Canvas, and React Native surfaces.

The shared host continues to own runtime updates, responsive sizing, text
measurement, focus resolution, keyboard behavior, built-in tooltips, selection,
and callbacks. `ChartRendererRenderContext` reports the live `surface` and the
stable interaction controller instead of assuming an SVG element.

Use `mountChartRenderer` from `@tanstack/charts/renderer`, or the React and
Octane `/core` entries, to mount a custom renderer. `RenderChartOptions`,
`ChartSurfaceRenderOptions`, `ChartSurface`, `ChartRenderer`,
`ChartRendererCapabilities`, `ChartRendererTooltipMotionCapability`,
`ChartTooltipMotionController`, `ChartTooltipMotionSnapshot`,
`ChartRendererRenderContext`, `ChartRendererHostCommonOptions`,
`ChartRendererHostOptions`, and `ChartRendererHost` describe the complete
boundary.

Import `resolveChartRenderer` from `@tanstack/charts/renderer` when implementing
a host outside the shared adapters. The function returns the effective renderer
for prerendering or mounting a scene. It returns the default when every node
uses that renderer. Otherwise it asks the first non-default
`ChartLayerRenderer` to compose the ordered layers with the default renderer.
The shared DOM host and `createChartRendererAdapter` perform this resolution
automatically.

SVG remains available as a renderer implementation:

```ts
import {
  createSvgChartRenderer,
  svgChartRenderer,
} from '@tanstack/charts/svg/renderer'
```

```ts
function createSvgChartRenderer<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
>(
  renderSvg?: ChartSvgRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>,
): ChartRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>

const svgChartRenderer: ChartRenderer
```

`createSvgChartRenderer` adapts a `ChartSvgRenderer` into a `ChartRenderer`.
Omitting the argument uses `renderChartSvg`. `svgChartRenderer` is the shared
preconfigured instance for renderer-neutral hosts that want the built-in SVG
surface.
Pass a `ChartSvgRenderer` as `renderSvg` to the compatibility SVG host or
default framework adapter when only SVG serialization needs to change. Such a
renderer should preserve:

- an SVG root discoverable by the host
- stable `data-ts-key` identities for reconciliation
- focus-filtered scene groups and data-less guides when chart-owned focus paint is
  desired
- the scene coordinate system and accessible name

See [Custom extensions](./custom-extensions.md#custom-renderers) before
replacing the shared renderer.
