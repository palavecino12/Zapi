Pass a compatible scale factory when its domain should come from mark channels.
Pass a scale instance when the domain is fixed application state. TanStack
Charts copies the resolved scale, assigns its responsive pixel range, and uses
that copy for marks, ticks, and interaction. A supplied instance is never
mutated.

Put positional mappings in the chart's `scales` registry. The reserved `x`
and `y` entries are the default bindings for Cartesian marks:

```ts
const scales = {
  x: { scale: scaleBand, axis: { label: 'Product' } },
  y: { scale: scaleLinear, grid: true, axis: { label: 'Revenue' } },
}
```

Start with the exact compact scale entry for numeric linear, band, point, or
ordinal mappings. Upgrade one mapping to D3 only when it needs temporal,
nonlinear, radial, interpolated, or statistical scale semantics. The
[Scales](../concepts/scales-and-d3.md) guide owns that decision and direct
dependency guidance. This page documents the TanStack Charts contract around
both implementations.

## Default compact scale entries

`@tanstack/charts` supplies four exact, tree-shakeable scale entries:

| Entry                             | Runtime export | Type contract  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `@tanstack/charts/scales/linear`  | `scaleLinear`  | `LinearScale`  |
| `@tanstack/charts/scales/band`    | `scaleBand`    | `BandScale`    |
| `@tanstack/charts/scales/point`   | `scalePoint`   | `PointScale`   |
| `@tanstack/charts/scales/ordinal` | `scaleOrdinal` | `OrdinalScale` |

`LinearScale` supports numeric two-stop domains and ranges, `invert`, `clamp`,
`ticks`, basic `tickFormat`, `nice`, and `copy`. `BandScale` supports
`padding`, `paddingInner`, `paddingOuter`, `align`, `round`, `rangeRound`,
`bandwidth`, `step`, and `copy`. `PointScale` exposes the corresponding point
operations with zero bandwidth. `OrdinalScale` supports explicit or implicit
domains, cyclic ranges, `unknown`, and `copy`.

```ts
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

const y = {
  scale: scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]),
}
```

The factories and returned instances satisfy `ChartScaleInput` directly. They
are a documented subset, not a complete `d3-scale` compatibility claim. Use D3
for temporal or transformed domains, piecewise and nonnumeric interpolation,
and full D3 formatting semantics.

`ConfiguredScaleLike` may expose `invert(position)`. Charts copies that
capability onto `ResolvedScale.invert` after assigning the responsive range.
Final-screen layouts and interactions can then recover semantic values without
copying the authored scale. Band scales do not expose inversion.

## Positional scale factories

The common path passes a compact factory directly:

```ts
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

const x = {
  scale: () => scaleBand<string>().padding(0.16),
  axis: { label: 'Product' },
}

const y = {
  scale: scaleLinear,
  nice: true,
  grid: true,
  axis: { label: 'Revenue' },
}
```

The chart creates a fresh scale for each layout, derives its domain from every
materialized channel bound to that axis, applies `nice`, and assigns the
responsive range. Bar and area baselines contribute zero when their baseline
is implicit. Empty channels retain the factory's native domain.

Return a configured scale from a zero-argument factory for options that should
be applied before domain inference:

```ts
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'

const x = {
  scale: () => scaleBand<string>().padding(0.2),
}
```

`nice` is an axis option because it must run after the inferred domain exists.

## D3 scale upgrades

Compact and D3 scales can coexist in one chart. This definition upgrades only
its temporal x mapping:

```ts
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { scaleUtc } from 'd3-scale'

const x = { scale: scaleUtc, nice: true }
const y = { scale: scaleLinear, nice: true }
```

Use `scaleTime` or `scaleUtc` when dates need elapsed-time spacing or
calendar-aware ticks. Compact band and point scales accept `Date` categories,
but adjacent categories remain equally spaced regardless of the time between
them.

Other D3-only scale families cover logarithmic, power, symlog, square-root,
radial, sequential, diverging, quantile, quantize, and threshold mappings. D3
linear scales add piecewise domains and ranges, nonnumeric interpolation, and
custom interpolators. The factory-versus-instance and responsive-range rules
remain unchanged after an upgrade.

## Fixed domains

Pass a scale instance when the domain is semantic application state:

```ts
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

const y = {
  scale: scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]),
}
```

Instances retain:

- their semantic domain
- continuous, temporal, logarithmic, ordinal, or band mapping behavior
- tick generation and default tick formatting
- clamping, unknown values, interpolation, and padding configured by the caller

TanStack Charts owns:

- factory-domain inference
- the responsive pixel range
- y-range orientation and optional axis reversal
- centering values within a band
- guide placement, label measurement, and margins

Scale copies make one configured scale safe to reuse across responsive scenes.

                  }
            }
        label?:
          | string
          | {

      }

```

| Option     | Default                      | Meaning                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scale`    | Required                     | Compact or D3 factory, configured instance, or custom `ChartScale`.      |
| `nice`     | `false`                      | Nice the resolved domain using the responsive or supplied tick count.    |
| `reverse`  | `false`                      | Reverses the responsive pixel range without changing the caller's scale. |
| `viewport` | None                         | Commits a continuous semantic window and optional transient translation. |
| `grid`     | `false`                      | Draws grid rules from semantic tick candidates.                          |
| `axis`     | Inferred axis                | Axis line, tick candidates, labels, and title; `false` hides the axis.   |
| `channel`  | Inferred for `x` and `y`     | Required on named scales; selects the Cartesian channel and range.       |
| `side`     | `bottom` for x; `left` for y | Places an x axis on top/bottom or a y axis on left/right.                |

Set `grid` or `axis.line` to a `ChartGuideLineStyle` object to enable the
guide and override its stroke, opacity, width, dash pattern, or line cap.
Omitted style fields keep the normal theme defaults. An empty object is
equivalent to `true`, and `axis.line` styles only the axis baseline, not its
tick stubs. Use finite non-negative widths and opacity values from zero to one.

```ts
type ChartContinuousValue = number | Date

type ChartContinuousDomain<
  TValue extends ChartContinuousValue = ChartContinuousValue,
> =
  | (Extract<TValue, number> extends never ? never : readonly [number, number])
  | (Extract<TValue, Date> extends never ? never : readonly [Date, Date])

interface ChartAxisViewportOptions<
  TValue extends ChartContinuousValue = ChartContinuousValue,
> {
  domain: ChartContinuousDomain<TValue>
  translate?: number
}
```

`ChartContinuousDomain` keeps numeric and temporal endpoints homogeneous at
the type boundary. At runtime, a viewport requires two distinct finite values
and a configured or inferable continuous scale with `invert`, ticks, clamping
disabled, and independently configurable domain and range behavior. Band,
ordinal, quantize, clamped, and getter-only scale inputs are rejected. An
authored `axis.viewport` is also rejected for a custom `ChartScale`.
Logarithmic content and viewport domains must be finite, nonzero, and stay on
the same side of zero.

`translate` is applied in screen-direction scene pixels after semantic
mapping: positive x moves right and positive y moves down, regardless of
domain order or `reverse`. Guides remain fixed. Viewport-dependent marks are
clipped and translated per mark and per owned axis; see
[Continuous viewports](../concepts/layout-axes-and-coordinates.md#continuous-viewports).

Set `scales.x` or `scales.y` to `null` only when no mark uses that positional
scale. To keep the scale while hiding its axis, use `axis: false`. Grid
visibility remains independent.

Without an explicit `axis.ticks` policy, the responsive target is
`clamp(2, floor(chart.width / 92), 8)` for x and
`clamp(2, floor(chart.height / 48), 7)` for y. The configured scale may return
a different number of ticks.

`count`, `spacing`, and `values` are mutually exclusive candidate policies.
`count` is a scale hint, `spacing` derives that hint from the final axis length,
and `values` supplies exact semantic candidates. Grid lines and tick stubs use
these candidates before label thinning.

Tick labels are horizontal and collision-thinned by default. Rotation is
explicit and independent:

```ts
import { scaleUtc } from 'd3-scale'

const x = {
  scale: scaleUtc,
  axis: {
    ticks: { spacing: 80, size: 0 },
    tickLabels: {
      rotate: -35,
      thin: {
        minGap: 8,
        priority: 'ends',
        keep: [launchDate],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`thin: false` renders every candidate label. `keep` is a hard guarantee:
kept values render even if they collide with one another. A kept value outside
the candidate set adds only a label, not a tick stub or grid line.

Tick-label presentation accepts constants or accessors. Accessors run on every
candidate before thinning and receive the semantic value, stable candidate
index, resolved center position, and resolved band width. Continuous scales
report a bandwidth of zero. Returning `undefined` preserves the normal value
for that candidate.

```ts
interface ChartAxisTickLabelContext<TValue extends ChartValue> {
  value: TValue
  index: number
  position: number
  bandwidth: number
}

const x = {
  scale: scaleBand<number>().domain(weeks),
  axis: {
    tickLabels: {
      fontSize: 13,
      opacity: 0.62,
      anchor: ({ index }) => (index === 0 ? 'start' : undefined),
      dx: ({ index, bandwidth }) => (index === 0 ? -bandwidth / 2 : undefined),
    },
  },
}
```

`anchor` defaults to an outward anchor derived from x rotation or the y-axis
side. The automatic value accounts for the host's inline direction. `dx` and
`dy` apply after the normal tick position and padding. Resolved font size,
weight, anchor, offset, opacity, and rotation all participate in collision
thinning and automatic margins. Numeric typography follows tick-label motion;
anchor changes snap.

Axis titles keep the compact string form when only text is needed. Use the
object form for title typography, paint, offset, or motion:

```ts
const y = {
  scale: scaleLinear,
  axis: {
    label: {
      text: 'Average order value (PLN)',
      fontSize: 14,
      fontWeight: 500,
      fill: '#363636',
      opacity: 0.9,
    },
  },
}
```

`fill` sets the text color. Omitted presentation fields retain the existing
title defaults: responsive 10 or 11 pixel sizing on x, 11 pixels on y, weight
600, theme foreground fill, and 0.76 fill opacity. Configured font size and
weight participate in text measurement, automatic offsets, and automatic
margins for SVG, Canvas, and native rendering.

## Named scales and multiple axes

The reserved `x` and `y` entries are the default bindings for Cartesian marks.
Add another entry when a mark needs an independent mapping, then bind that mark
with `xScale` or `yScale`:

```ts
const chart = defineChart({
  marks: [
    lineY(revenue, { x: 'date', y: 'value' }),
    lineY(conversion, {
      x: 'date',
      y: 'rate',
      yScale: 'conversion',
    }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scaleUtc },
    y: {
      scale: scaleLinear,
      grid: true,
      axis: { label: 'Revenue' },
    },
    conversion: {
      channel: 'y',
      scale: scaleLinear,
      side: 'right',
      axis: {
        label: 'Conversion',
        ticks: { format: (value: number) => `${Math.round(value * 100)}%` },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

<!-- ::chart-example id=70-composed-chart height=480 -->

A named scale must declare `channel: 'x'` or `channel: 'y'`. Its mark binding
must use the same channel. The ID `color` is reserved for the shared visual
color scale and cannot name a Cartesian position scale.

Every non-null scale renders an axis by default. Set `axis: false` when a
mapping should not draw another axis. X scales can use the top or bottom side,
and y scales can use the left or right side. Axes on the same side stack
outward and contribute their measured size to the automatic margin.

Axis sides stay physical in a right-to-left container, so `side: 'right'`
still puts the axis on the right. Automatic tick anchors account for the
container's inline direction and keep labels outside the plot. An explicitly
authored `start` or `end` anchor remains logical. Text measurement, SVG,
Canvas, native rendering, and standalone SVG export preserve that direction.

## Automatic guide layout

When a margin side is omitted, the scene compiler measures:

- formatted tick glyph bounds
- tick rotation
- first and last label overhang
- axis title bounds and offset
- Cartesian `text`-mark anchors, pixel offsets, and rotation
- color legend height

The DOM host measures the inherited container font and relayouts after web
fonts load. Static compilation uses deterministic estimates unless
`measureText` is supplied. Explicit margin sides remain locked, and
`clip: true` prevents clipped mark labels from expanding the plot.

```ts
interface ChartTextMeasurer {
  (
    text: string,
    options: {
      fontSize: number
      fontWeight?: number
      fontFamily: string
      fontStyle: string
      fontStretch: string
      letterSpacing: number
      direction: 'ltr' | 'rtl' | 'inherit'
      locale?: string
      fontScale: number
      anchor: 'start' | 'middle' | 'end'
      baseline: 'auto' | 'middle' | 'hanging'
    },
  ): {
    x: number
    y: number
    width: number
    height: number
  }
}
```

The returned `x` and `y` locate the painted glyph box relative to the requested
anchor and baseline. Pass the measurer through a host, adapter, runtime render,
or `createChartScene` layout options. The callback is synchronous; a host owns
font loading or asynchronous native measurement and recompiles the scene when
those metrics become ready. `fontScale` applies to the painted font size and
letter spacing, so custom measurers must include it in their result.

## Custom scales

`ChartScale` is the final extension boundary for a nonstandard positional
mapping. Prefer a compact scale, then a D3 scale with the required semantics,
before implementing this contract:

```ts
interface ChartScale {
  id: string
  resolve(context: ChartScaleResolveContext): ResolvedScale
}

type ChartScaleResolver = (context: ChartScaleResolveContext) => ResolvedScale
```

The resolver context contains `id`, all materialized `values`, the responsive
`range`, the axis `options`, a target `tickCount`, and `includeZero`. It must
return a complete `ResolvedScale`:

```ts
interface ResolvedScale {
  id: string
  type: string
  domain: readonly ChartValue[]
  map(value: unknown): number
  invert?(position: number): ChartValue
  ticks: readonly { value: ChartValue; label: string; position: number }[]
  bandwidth: number
  viewport?: {
    contentDomain: readonly ChartValue[]
    domain: ChartContinuousDomain
    translate: number
    map(value: unknown): number
  }
}
```

Prefer a compact or D3 scale when it can express the mapping. A custom scale
owns correct domains, finite mapping, ticks, formatting, bandwidth, and
response to the supplied range. Do not wrap an existing compact or D3 scale in
`ChartScale`.

The host cannot apply an authored `axis.viewport` to an opaque custom
`ChartScale`. A custom resolver can return a complete
`ResolvedScale.viewport` itself, in which case it owns the content domain,
committed domain, translation, and presented mapper.

## Color

Data-paint marks accept a semantic `color` channel. On marks that also expose
`z`, grouping remains independent and supplies the color value only when
`color` is omitted. `fill` and `stroke` are final paint overrides, so they do
not contribute to the scale or legend.

Omit `color.scale` to use the theme palette. Use the compact ordinal scale when
categories need a stable application-owned mapping:

```ts
import { scaleOrdinal } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/ordinal'

const statusColor = scaleOrdinal(
  ['healthy', 'warning', 'critical'],
  ['#16a34a', '#f59e0b', '#dc2626'],
)
```

Upgrade color to D3 for continuous interpolation or quantile, quantize, and
threshold policy.

```ts
interface ConfiguredColorScaleLike<TValue extends ChartKey, TOutput> {
  (value: TValue): TOutput
  copy: () => ConfiguredColorScaleLike<TValue, TOutput>
  domain?: () => readonly TValue[]
  range?: () => readonly TOutput[]
}

interface ChartColorOptions {
  scale?: ConfiguredColorScaleLike<any, any> | ChartColorScaleFactory<any, any>
  resolver?: ChartColorScale
  domain?: readonly ChartKey[]
  range?: readonly string[]
  nice?: boolean | number
  legend?: ChartColorLegend
}
```

| Option     | Default                 | Meaning                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scale`    | None                    | Compatible factory with inference or instance with a fixed domain |
| `resolver` | None                    | Custom color-scale resolver                                       |
| `domain`   | Observed channel values | Domain hint for factory, built-in, or custom resolution           |
| `range`    | See below               | Range for a factory, the built-in scale, or a custom resolver     |
| `nice`     | `false`                 | Nice a factory or configured continuous color scale               |
| `legend`   | None                    | Legend layout and scene renderer shown above the inner chart      |

Resolution order:

1. `color.scale`, created or copied before use
2. custom `color.resolver`
3. the built-in ordinal scale using `domain` or observed channel values and
   `range` or the theme palette

A color-scale factory is classified by its capabilities:

- ordinal factories infer first-seen distinct values;
- continuous and quantize factories infer the finite extent;
- quantile factories receive the complete numeric population;
- threshold factories require an explicit domain of authored cuts.

The theme palette is the range default only for the built-in ordinal scale.
A D3 factory must receive `color.range` or return a scale already configured
with a non-empty string range or interpolator; bare D3 factories retain
numeric or empty defaults that are not valid paint. Multi-stop continuous
ranges receive evenly spaced domain stops across the extent. A supplied scale
instance retains its domain and range. Outputs are converted to strings. A
custom `ChartColorScale` receives observed values, optional domain and range,
and the resolved theme, then returns:

```ts
interface ResolvedColorScale {
  type: string
  kind?: 'categorical' | 'continuous' | 'quantile' | 'quantize' | 'threshold'
  domain: readonly ChartKey[]
  range: readonly string[]
  thresholds?: readonly number[]
  map(value: ChartKey | null | undefined): string
}
```

`ChartKey` is `string | number`. On the built-in and configured-scale paths, a
null color value maps to the first range color or `currentColor`. A custom
`ChartColorScale` owns its null mapping through `ResolvedColorScale.map`. A
custom stepped scale supplies exact interior legend boundaries with
`thresholds`; D3 quantile, quantize, and threshold scales derive them
automatically.

## Automatic color legend

```ts
import { colorLegend, colorLegendItems } from '@tanstack/charts/legend'

colorLegend({
  label: 'Package',
  itemWidth: 120,
  items: colorLegendItems({
    justify: 'center',
    gap: 16,
    indicator: { shape: 'square' },
    label: { fontSize: 12 },
  }),
  width: 240,
  format: (value) => value.toFixed(0),
  placement: 'bottom',
})
```

```ts
interface ColorLegendOptions<TValue extends ChartKey = ChartKey> {
  label?: string
  itemWidth?: number
  items?: ColorLegendItems<TValue>
  width?: number
  format?: (value: number) => string
  placement?: 'top' | 'bottom'
}

declare function colorLegendItems<TValue extends ChartKey = ChartKey>(
  options?: ColorLegendItemOptions<TValue>,
): ColorLegendItems<TValue>

// Opaque presentation returned by colorLegendItems().
interface ColorLegendItems<in TValue extends ChartKey = ChartKey> {}

interface ColorLegendItemContext {
  color: string
  index: number
  label: string
}

interface ColorLegendIndicatorRenderContext extends ColorLegendItemContext {
  bounds: ChartBounds
}

type ColorLegendItemValue<TValue extends ChartKey, TResult> =
  TResult | ((value: TValue, context: ColorLegendItemContext) => TResult)

type ColorLegendIndicatorShape = 'dot' | 'square' | 'line' | 'line-dot'

interface ColorLegendItemOptions<TValue extends ChartKey = ChartKey> {
  justify?: 'start' | 'center' | 'stretch'
  gap?: number
  rowGap?: number
  indicator?: ColorLegendIndicatorOptions<TValue>
  label?: ColorLegendLabelOptions<TValue>
}

interface ColorLegendIndicatorOptions<TValue extends ChartKey = ChartKey> {
  shape?: ColorLegendItemValue<TValue, ColorLegendIndicatorShape>
  width?: number
  height?: number
  gap?: number
  render?: (
    value: TValue,
    context: ColorLegendIndicatorRenderContext,
  ) => SceneNode | readonly SceneNode[]
}

interface ColorLegendLabelOptions<TValue extends ChartKey = ChartKey> {
  format?: (value: TValue) => string
  fontSize?: number
  fontWeight?: number
  fill?: ColorLegendItemValue<TValue, string>
  fillOpacity?: number
}
```

`items` applies only to categorical scales. The default `stretch`
justification uses equal-width columns. In this mode, `itemWidth` defaults to
`110` and is clamped to a minimum of `64`. `start` and `center` instead measure
each formatted label with the chart host's configured typography, wrap compact
rows, and use `gap` between items. Invalid host measurements fall back to the
same deterministic estimator used by chart layout.

Configured items default to a `16` pixel compact-layout gap, an `8` pixel row
gap, an `8` by `8` dot with a `5` pixel label gap, `11` pixel label text, and
`String` label formatting. Measured label height reserves enough room for each
row. If an indicator is wider than its allocated item, its bounds stop at the
item edge.

`indicator.shape` selects a dot, square, line, or line with an outlined point.
`width`, `height`, and `gap` reserve the indicator box and its distance from
the label. A custom `render` callback receives the categorical value plus
`{ bounds, color, index, label }`; the built-in legend still measures, wraps,
and positions the item. Label `fill` callbacks receive the same resolved color
and formatted label. A line-dot center uses the chart background, or the host's
`Canvas` color when that background is transparent, so it remains hollow on
light and dark hosts.

An item presentation can handle the same value type as its legend or a broader
one. TypeScript rejects a narrower presentation because its callbacks could
otherwise receive a value they do not accept.

Continuous scales render a sampled ramp. Quantize, quantile, and threshold
scales render exact range bins at their resolved thresholds. `width` and the
top-level `format` configure these quantitative forms, and `items` is ignored.
`placement` defaults to `top`.

This mixed-series legend uses only the resolved color scale for labels and
paint:

```ts
type Series = 'Revenue' | 'Orders'

colorLegend({
  placement: 'bottom',
  items: colorLegendItems<Series>({
    justify: 'center',
    gap: 20,
    rowGap: 10,
    indicator: {
      width: 20,
      height: 14,
      gap: 6,
      shape: (series) => (series === 'Revenue' ? 'line-dot' : 'square'),
    },
    label: {
      fontSize: 14,
      fill: (_series, { color }) => color,
    },
  }),
})
```

## Gradient legend

```ts
import { colorGradientLegend } from '@tanstack/charts/legend'

colorGradientLegend({
  label: 'Density',
  steps: 48,
  width: 240,
  format: (value) => value.toFixed(1),
  placement: 'bottom',
})
```

```ts
interface ColorGradientLegendOptions {
  label?: string
  steps?: number
  width?: number
  format?: (value: number) => string
  placement?: 'top' | 'bottom'
}
```

`steps` defaults to `32` and is clamped to at least `2`. `width` defaults to
`240`, uses at least `80` when space permits, and is finally capped by the
inner chart width. The legend requires a numeric first and last color-domain
value and throws for a nonnumeric domain.

## Interactive categorical legend

```ts
import { controlledSignal } from '@tanstack/charts/interaction/signal'
import { interactiveColorLegend } from '@tanstack/charts/legend'

interactiveColorLegend({
  visible: controlledSignal(visibleSeries, setVisibleSeries),
  placement: 'bottom',
  ariaLabel: 'Series visibility',
})
```

```ts
interface InteractiveColorLegendChange<TValue extends ChartKey> {
  type: 'toggle'
  value: TValue
  visible: boolean
}

interface InteractiveColorLegendItemContext {
  visible: boolean
}

interface InteractiveColorLegendOptions<TValue extends ChartKey> {
  visible: ControlledSignal<
    readonly TValue[],
    InteractiveColorLegendChange<TValue>
  >
  placement?: 'top' | 'bottom'
  ariaLabel?: string
  itemWidth?: number
  format?: (value: TValue) => string
  itemAriaLabel?: (
    value: TValue,
    context: InteractiveColorLegendItemContext,
  ) => string
  emptyLabel?: string
}
```

The application owns the current visible-value snapshot and handles each
proposed replacement. The legend owns domain-ordered toggling, responsive
layout, and native browser buttons. It filters series geometry and focus points
after scale resolution, so hidden values remain in categorical and positional
domains. A mark participates when its categorical `color` channel establishes
series identity without a separate `z` channel.

The DOM hosts replace the scene fallback with native `button` elements. Static
SVG output retains a noninteractive visual fallback. This control is not yet
implemented by the React Native host.

## Custom legends

`ChartColorLegend` separates layout from rendering:

```ts
interface ChartColorLegend {
  height(itemCount: number, context: ChartColorLegendContext): number
  placement?: 'top' | 'bottom'
  render(context: ChartColorLegendContext): SceneNode
}
```

`height` returns the reserved pixel height before chart bounds are finalized.
Both callbacks receive the resolved colors, plot and legend bounds, theme, and
full chart size. `render` returns one keyed
[scene node](./runtime-and-scene.md#scene-nodes). Browser host controls are an
advanced extension boundary used by `interactiveColorLegend`; ordinary custom
legends should remain renderer-neutral scene output.

## Theme and gradients

The built-in theme is described in [Chart spec](./chart-spec.md#theme).
Chart gradients are renderer-neutral resources:

```ts
interface ChartGradientBase {
  id: string
  stops: readonly ChartGradientStop[]
}

interface ChartGradientStop {
  offset: number
  color: string
  opacity?: number
}

interface ChartLinearGradient extends ChartGradientBase {
  type?: 'linear'
  x1?: number
  y1?: number
  x2?: number
  y2?: number
}

interface ChartRadialGradient extends ChartGradientBase {
  type: 'radial'
  cx?: number
  cy?: number
  r?: number
  fx?: number
  fy?: number
}

type ChartGradient = ChartLinearGradient | ChartRadialGradient
```

Coordinates and stop offsets use SVG-style `objectBoundingBox` values
normalized from `0` to `1`. Renderers clamp values to that range. Stops keep
their authored order, and an offset below the previous stop is clamped forward
to the previous offset. A linear gradient may omit `type` for compatibility.
Its omitted coordinates form a vertical gradient from bottom to top, from
`(0, 1)` to `(0, 0)`. A radial gradient requires `type: 'radial'`; `cx`, `cy`,
and `r` default to `0.5`, while omitted `fx` and `fy` independently inherit the
resolved center coordinate.

Reference either kind from a mark's `fill` or `stroke` as `url(#resource-id)`.
SVG and React Native support both kinds for fills and strokes. Canvas renders
exact `objectBoundingBox` radial fills, including the elliptical result on a
non-square shape. Canvas radial strokes are not supported because a nonuniform
bounds transform would also distort stroke width; the Canvas renderer throws
instead of painting a misleading approximation. Linear gradients continue to
support Canvas fills and strokes.

`ChartGradient`, `ChartGradientBase`, `ChartGradientStop`,
`ChartLinearGradient`, and `ChartRadialGradient` are type exports from
`@tanstack/charts`, `@tanstack/charts/universal`, and
`@tanstack/charts/types`. Use an `idPrefix` when charts share a document; see
[Rendering and export](./rendering-and-export.md#svg-resources).
