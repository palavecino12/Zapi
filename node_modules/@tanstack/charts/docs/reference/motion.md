title: Motion
description: Optional SVG tween and spring motion, definition-local timing, interruption behavior, reduced motion, and the standalone spring sampler.
---

Motion is an optional renderer. Core definitions, scene compilation, static SVG,
and Canvas do not import a clock or physics solver.

## `motion`

```ts
import { motion } from '@tanstack/charts/motion'

const renderer = motion({
  transition: { type: 'spring', stiffness: 170, damping: 18, mass: 1 },
})
```

```ts
function motion(options?: ChartMotionOptions): UniversalChartRenderer

function motion<
  TDatum = unknown,
  TXValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
  TYValue extends ChartValue = ChartValue,
>(options?: ChartMotionOptions): ChartRenderer<TDatum, TXValue, TYValue>

interface ChartMotionOptions {
  initial?: boolean | 'always'
  transition?: ChartMotionTransition
  respectReducedMotion?: boolean
  resize?: boolean
}
```

Use `motion(options)` beside a typed definition and let the host infer its
datum and axis values. The explicit generic overload remains available when a
low-level caller must type the renderer before it has a definition.

| Option                 | Default                                       | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initial`              | `true`                                        | Animate first client paint; `always` also replays adopted SVG |
| `transition`           | 1,100 ms tween with the default entrance ease | Renderer-wide fallback                                        |
| `respectReducedMotion` | `true`                                        | Snap when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` matches            |
| `resize`               | `false`                                       | Animate updates caused only by a chart size change            |

Server-rendered SVG is adopted without replaying entrance motion by default.
Set `initial: 'always'` when a hydrated chart should replay the same entrance
as a client-only mount. Keyed updates start from painted geometry. An
interrupted spring carries its sampled value and velocity into the new target.
A spring has no duration; it finishes when both `restSpeed` and `restDelta` are
satisfied, with a 10-second safety limit.

Initial choreography follows geometry: Cartesian bars and paths grow from
their semantic baseline, radial lines and areas grow from the polar center,
and arcs sweep through their authored angle. Keyed removals stay painted
through their exit transition.

Data-less `crosshair` marks use the same keyed focus-motion path. Rapid pointer
or keyboard retargeting preserves the guide elements and incoming spring
velocity; labels remain aligned to their moving rules.

The built-in HTML tooltip also consumes this renderer's transition. Entry,
movement, retargeting, and exit therefore use the same spring without copying
the transition into the chart definition. A static renderer keeps the tooltip
immediate and does not import the motion runtime.

Use the renderer-neutral host in vanilla applications:

```ts
import { mountChartRenderer } from '@tanstack/charts/renderer'
import { motion } from '@tanstack/charts/motion'

const host = mountChartRenderer(container, {
  definition,
  renderer: motion(),
  width: 640,
  height: 360,
  ariaLabel: 'Monthly revenue',
})
```

React and Octane applications use their `/core` component entry and pass the
same renderer. Other adapters start with their default SVG renderer, and a
definition may still select Canvas for individual marks.

## Definition-local motion

`motion` on a definition, mark, axis, tick collection, tick-label collection,
or axis label is inert policy. The optional renderer consumes it. Definitions
remain valid for static SVG and Canvas, which paint the final state.

This stays true in a mixed chart. A mark that selects `canvasChartRenderer`
keeps its authored motion option, but the Canvas layer paints the final scene
instead of running the tween or spring policy. The optional `motion()` renderer
still animates the default-renderer layers it owns.

```ts
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'

const definition = defineChart({
  motion: {
    transition: { type: 'spring', stiffness: 170, damping: 18 },
  },
  marks: [
    lineY(rows, {
      id: 'forecast',
      x: 'month',
      y: 'forecast',
      key: 'id',
      motion: { transition: { type: 'spring', mass: 1.25 } },
    }),
    dot(rows, {
      x: 'month',
      y: 'actual',
      key: 'id',
      motion(context) {
        return {
          delay: context.phase === 'enter' ? context.datumIndex * 35 : 0,
        }
      },
    }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: {
      scale: scaleBand,
      axis: {
        ticks: { motion: { transition: { type: 'tween', duration: 180 } } },
        tickLabels: { motion: { delay: 40 } },
      },
    },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear },
  },
})
```

The cascade is renderer default, chart, mark, axis, specific guide, then the
active focus-state transition. Same-type transitions inherit omitted fields.
Set `motion: false` at any definition scope to suppress inherited motion for
that scope. A more specific child can re-enable motion with its own definition.
An authored `delay` replaces automatic entrance staggering for that target.
Spring updates begin immediately even when a definition returns a delay, so a
retarget cannot freeze incoming momentum. Spring enter and exit delays, and
tween delays in every phase, are honored.

All built-in marks accept `ChartMarkMotionOptions<TDatum>`. Nested polar marks
also accept `motion`; their timing is merged below the parent `polar` mark.

| Scope                          | Motion input                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Renderer fallback              | `motion({ transition })`                             |
| Whole chart                    | `defineChart({ motion })`                            |
| Any built-in mark              | The mark's `motion` option                           |
| Axis, including its grid lines | `x.axis.motion` or `y.axis.motion`                   |
| Tick rules                     | `axis.ticks.motion`                                  |
| Tick labels                    | `axis.tickLabels.motion`                             |
| Axis label                     | `axis.label.motion` when `label` is an object        |
| Crosshair or focus guide       | The guide mark's `motion` option                     |
| HTML tooltip                   | Inherits chart motion; `tooltip.motion` overrides it |

Grid lines use their axis policy because they are part of that axis's guide
system. `tooltip.motion: false` keeps the tooltip immediate even when chart
geometry animates. Legends and application-owned controls are not marks and do
not currently participate in the motion cascade.

## Spreading timing utilities

Use the isolated timing entry when the definition only needs motion policy:

```ts
import { stagger } from '@tanstack/charts/motion/definition'

const definition = defineChart({
  motion: {
    path: 'morph',
    ...stagger({ each: 35, by: 'series', roles: ['arc', 'bar'] }),
  },
  marks,
  scales: {
    x: null,
    y: null,
  },
})
```

`stagger()` returns one context-aware `delay` field for direct object spread.
It uses `datumIndex` by default, can use `seriesIndex`, defaults to the `enter`
phase, and can filter by phase and semantic role. `offset` delays the first
target. Normal object-spread order controls precedence, so an explicit `delay`
written after `...stagger()` replaces it.

```ts
interface ChartMotionStaggerOptions {
  each: number
  offset?: number
  by?: 'datum' | 'series'
  phase?: ChartMotionPhase | readonly ChartMotionPhase[]
  roles?: ChartMotionRole | readonly ChartMotionRole[]
}
```

`stagger()` is also exported from `@tanstack/charts/motion`. The dedicated
`/motion/definition` entry excludes the SVG renderer and spring solver.

## Timing types

```ts
type ChartMotionPhase = 'enter' | 'update' | 'exit'

interface ChartMotionTweenTransition {
  type: 'tween'
  duration?: number
  easing?:
    | 'linear'
    | 'ease'
    | 'ease-in'
    | 'ease-out'
    | 'ease-in-out'
    | ((progress: number) => number)
}

interface ChartMotionSpringTransition extends ChartSpringOptions {
  type: 'spring'
}

type ChartMotionTransition =
  ChartMotionTweenTransition | ChartMotionSpringTransition

interface ChartRollingPathMotion {
  update: 'rolling'
  x: 'shift'
  y?: 'fixed' | 'reproject'
  fallback?: 'snap' | 'morph'
}

type ChartMotionPath = 'morph' | ChartRollingPathMotion

interface ChartMotionTiming<TDatum = unknown> {
  delay?: number | ((context: ChartMotionContext<TDatum>) => number | undefined)
  transition?: ChartMotionTransition
  path?: ChartMotionPath
}

type ChartMotionDefinition<TDatum = unknown> =
  | false
  | ChartMotionTiming<TDatum>
  | ((
      context: ChartMotionContext<TDatum>,
    ) => false | ChartMotionTiming<TDatum> | undefined)

interface ChartMarkMotionOptions<TDatum = unknown> {
  motion?: ChartMotionDefinition<TDatum>
}
```

`ChartMotionContext` provides `phase`, semantic `role`, stable `key`, optional
`markId`, `seriesKey`, `seriesIndex`, `datumIndex`, `datumCount`, optional typed
`datum` and `point`, and optional `axis`. `ChartMotionRole` covers marks, axes,
grid lines, ticks, tick labels, and axis labels.

Focus styles use `ChartMarkStateTransition`, which is a
`ChartMotionTransition` plus optional `respectReducedMotion`.

`path: 'morph'` is the ordinary command-by-command path interpolation. A
rolling update is configured only with the `ChartRollingPathMotion` object.

## Rolling paths

Path morphing matches SVG path commands. That is useful when values change in
place, but a rolling time series should keep each retained sample intact and
move the trace left:

```ts
const definition = defineChart({
  motion: {
    path: {
      update: 'rolling',
      x: 'shift',
      y: 'reproject',
      fallback: 'snap',
    },
    transition: { type: 'tween', duration: 800, easing: 'linear' },
  },
  marks: [lineY(rows, { x: 'time', y: 'value', key: 'id' })],
  scales: {
    x: { scale: scaleUtc().domain([visibleStart, visibleEnd]) },
    y: { scale: scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]) },
  },

  clip: true,
})
```

Include enough keyed samples before `visibleStart` to cover the largest
expected update batch. A valid rolling update installs the completed path
beyond the right clip, applies one affine transform that reproduces the prior
frame, and animates that transform to identity. Retained samples therefore move
as one piece while new samples enter from the right.

The renderer validates the update before animating it:

- retained keys must be the exact old suffix and new prefix;
- the keyed primitive must remain a line or remain an area;
- added and removed sample counts must balance;
- retained semantic x, y, interval, and group values must be unchanged;
- every retained x coordinate must share one translation;
- the plot bounds must be stable and the path must be inside a clip;
- neither the previous nor target path may have a nonzero transient x or y
  viewport translation;
- the target geometry must cover both clip edges throughout the shift;
- custom path strings and neighbor-sensitive curves do not use the affine
  path.

Omitting `y` is equivalent to `y: 'fixed'` and requires unchanged screen y
coordinates. `y: 'reproject'` also
accepts a changed continuous y-domain when one affine y transform maps the new
projection back to the previous frame. This preserves the path geometry while
the line shifts and the y-axis updates. Keep an area's baseline semantically
stable, such as `y1: 0`, so both edges can be reprojected.

`fallback` defaults to `'snap'`. An update that does not satisfy the rolling
contract is installed without an unrelated path morph. Use
`fallback: 'morph'` only when command interpolation is the intended failure
behavior.

A valid update that interrupts another rolling update composes the transform
currently painted on the path with the next shift, then continues toward the
new target. It does not reset to either completed scene. Presentation points,
focus marks, and an active tooltip follow the same composed geometry.

Authored point dots and default focus circles use the path's rolling timing.
Entering points begin under the composed transform, exiting points travel out
through the clip, and snap fallback removes stale exiting presentation points
in the same commit as the path. A focus layer can update immediately during
data motion; geometry or style from an inline mark state waits until the active
data transition settles so it cannot cancel the rolling transform. Back-to-back
updates retain the latest requested state and apply it when the feed becomes
idle; a feed that never becomes idle keeps state geometry deferred while focus
layers and tooltips continue to follow presentation points.

Rolling motion rejects a nonzero `viewport.translate` on either axis because
the viewport and path would otherwise own competing transient transforms.
Commit the viewport domain and reset its translation before the rolling data
update, or expect the configured snap-or-morph fallback.

Use fixed plot margins so changing tick-label widths cannot change the affine
frame. Use linear segments or a curve whose visible control points do not
change when a sample is appended.

`motion()` renders SVG clip paths and gradients itself, so `clip: true` applies
to the animated marks without a separate resource renderer.

## Standalone spring

```ts
import { createChartSpring } from '@tanstack/charts/spring'

const spring = createChartSpring({ stiffness: 170, damping: 18, mass: 1 })
const sample = spring.sample(16, { from: 0, to: 100, velocity: 0 })
```

```ts
interface ChartSpringOptions {
  stiffness?: number
  damping?: number
  mass?: number
  restSpeed?: number
  restDelta?: number
}

interface ChartSpringState {
  from: number
  to: number
  velocity?: number
}

interface ChartSpringSample {
  value: number
  velocity: number
  done: boolean
}

interface ChartSpring {
  readonly options: Readonly<Required<ChartSpringOptions>>
  sample(elapsedMs: number, state?: ChartSpringState): ChartSpringSample
}
```

`createChartSpring` returns an analytic, frame-rate-independent damped harmonic
oscillator. Values and velocities use caller units per second. Seed a new
`ChartSpringState` from the prior sample to preserve momentum across targets.

## Compatibility

- Compatible numeric attributes and path command skeletons interpolate.
- Incompatible element types or path topology use keyed enter/exit opacity.
- Stable keys preserve DOM identity, velocity, and presentation points.
- Crosshair rules, bands, labels, and markers follow the same keyed interruption
  behavior as focused marks.
- SVG interaction follows animated presentation geometry for keyed built-in and
  custom marks.
- Static SVG and Canvas ignore definition motion and paint final geometry.
- The optional renderer is browser SVG only; it is not a Web Animations, View
  Transitions, Canvas, or native adapter.
